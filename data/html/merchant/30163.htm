I bid you welcome to the Ivory Tower.<br>
Although best known as a lair for Mystics, actually a lot of non-magical people are also here. For instance, myself! I was once a Paladin pledged to Einhasad! I still try to remain true to the faith.<br>
Strange things have been known to happen at this tower, but if you think about them too much you will be consumed by it, so don't ask too many questions. It would be dangerous.<br>
