Yes, that's right! Have you come to buy something? What should I do? I want to sell to you, but it is against the law to sell to a wanted criminal. If I violate the law, then my brother will go to prison ... so I can't. I'm so sorry. Won't you come by our shop now and then, though? It is so fun talking to you ... I can't wait to tell my friends! Don't forget, you promised to stop by and talk to me once in a while!
