Welcome to Hunters Village! Isn't it wonderful? We Dwarves live in the north part of town, and most of us are in the mining business. But we're certainly not averse to beautiful scenery and wondrous living creatures! The beauty of this place is reflected in the wide variety of minerals found here. Life couldn't get any better than this!<br>
