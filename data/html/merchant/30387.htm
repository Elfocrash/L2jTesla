Welcome. Did you come here to embark on a boat trip? Gludin is going to have many passenger liners now. Can you believe it? A regular passenger liner from Elmore Kingdom which once was our our enemy...! Although you can't feel the passion or liveliness of the past here, I am hopeful that now I see that some things seem to be getting better.<br>
Oh, and there's no fee for the boat ride to Rune Castle Town in Elmore territory since we are test marketing this new route.<br>
