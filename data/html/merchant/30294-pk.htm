Our shop must be famous, seeing how wanted criminals brave the danger of town to visit us. Well, it's true that there aren't that many shops with such wonderful items or such a dashing owner. Nonetheless ... Recently, someone broke the law and sold an item to a wanted criminal. He was put through great pain. I'm sorry, but please come back when you're free. I promise I will give you the royal treatment.
