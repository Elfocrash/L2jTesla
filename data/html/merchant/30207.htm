Greetings. Welcome to our shop, with its one hundred years of tradition. We have all the weapons and defense items an adventurer could ever possibly need, so please take your time to look around. You know, they say undead monsters frequently come out of the ruins left from the war with Gracia. A strong weapon against the undead may come in handy.<br>
