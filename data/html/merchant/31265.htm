Humans are overlooking benefits that striders gave to the civilization!  Think about it!  Strategies at the siege or large-scaled pledge war have changed because of striders, haven't they?  The trade has been also stimulated since it became easier to deliver cargos between towns.<br>
Ah, ah~!  Should I write a book or something?  I'll title it, "Swift Horse and History of the Continent," huh?<br>
