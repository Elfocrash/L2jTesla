Hmm... Welcome to my shop. You can expect honest treatment here. Ah, high-level Spellbooks are very hard to get. I have heard that the monsters around the Ivory Tower possess them. You might try there. Who knows? Fortunately, you might get a high-level Spellbook. Would you like to see my wares?<br>
