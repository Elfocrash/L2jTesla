Thank you as always. As I am sure you are aware, we sell only the finest handmade products of Artisans. We value high-quality weapons such as these due to our status as the capital city and our proximity to the border with that horrible wasteland Elmore.<br>
You must take care when you deal with other traders. There are scoundrels about who sell inferior weapons at inflated prices...<br>
