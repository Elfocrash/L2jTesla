I don't know if you know this, but this wharf was once so ridiculously shabby it couldn't even be properly called a wharf! Compared to then, it's a heck of a lot better now. <br>
I still get a chill down my back thinking about those days...<br>
From time to time, those horrifying dinosaurs would even charge down from the jungle to devour the settlers. Now you see me as an old wharf manager, but back then I was just a hot-blooded young adventurer like you spoiling for a fight! Some days I was ready to tear into them with my bare hands. Of course, then I saw what they could do to the unskilled... Ah, but I still miss the days of my youth.<br>
