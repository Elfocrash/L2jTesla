Ahem, my name is Shari. They say it's not an appropriate name for a girl, but I'm proud of it. I was an orphan, but I'm pretty successful now, having my own shop.

I was named the 324th excellent salesperson for selling thirty items everyday and establishing a new record. After two years, I became the youngest shop owner.
