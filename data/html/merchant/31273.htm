Are you here to see my blueprints? Do you like this one? It's by Tobald himself! He's the older brother of Master Toma! Truly a maestro of design, and the top craftsman of our guild!<br>
What do you mean, "It looks ordinary."? You obviously have no idea what you're talking about! You have no eye for detail! The exquisite design of these wheel drive parts are certainly not ordinary!<br>
