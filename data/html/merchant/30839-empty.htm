You shouldn't joke about such matters!  Were you hit by a pickpocket?  You must be very careful.  Did you know that? This town has many rich people, and also a good number of pickpockets who prey upon them.  Elves and Dwarves are the usual culprits.  It is very rare to see an Orc do such things.  They are more like a robber...? Ah, just kidding.  In fact, they cherish the dignity and honor.  To steal secretly doesn't suit for Orcs.<br>
