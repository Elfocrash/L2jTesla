<html><body>Wharf Manager Felton:<br>
This wharf is visited by many vessels from ports both near and far, including Talking Island. Without this wharf the market in Giran would be devastated. Right now passengers liners, small cargo ships and a few fishermen are only ones using the wharf. Soon, however, a village will be established near here. I heard a rumor that Dwarves are behind the project... Since the foundation for the village has already been constructed, the only thing left is to receive the approval of the lord.<br>
