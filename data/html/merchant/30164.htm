Welcome to the Ivory Tower, headquarters of magic!<br>
People think that the Ivory Tower is a mere research facility, but it actually has enough power to shake the continent! Would you care to guess where all the knowledge and data are stored? Right here, inside the tower of course!<br>If the world suddenly ends, or is prevented from ending, the tower will be responsible.<br>
