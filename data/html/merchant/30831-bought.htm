<html><body>Pet Manager Nelson:<br>
We only sell the highest-quality merchandise, our pet foods are among the best in the land. They are made with meat from local game... Some customers not only give them to pets but also eat since they smell great...<br>
I'm not sure what is in it, and don't have any intention of eating any of it...<br>
