Welcome! Are you tired? You can rest here. What brings you here? Ah, you don't need to say. Yes, of course I know why people come to Hunters Village! People want to hunt... Am I right?<br>
This village is a home to various types of hunters. Don't just stand there, come on over and check out the items. You may have mistaken me for one of those shopkeepers who stands around all day, talking and talking, going on and on, about nothing at all...!<br>
