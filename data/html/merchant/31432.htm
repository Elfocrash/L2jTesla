<html><body>Blueprint Seller Reeya:<br>
Oh my! Have you seen this blueprint? I never thought of designing a golem this way. It's amazing! The composition is truly artistic. Perfectly symmetrical, simple and flawlessly assembled! An example of top-notch engineering! Definitely the work of a master craftsman! I'll give you a good deal on this one! I'll probably regret this later... You should buy from me while I'm in such a good mood, friend!<br>
