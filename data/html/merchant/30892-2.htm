It is formally known as the Aden Trade Guild.  "Aden" refers to the entire kingdom.  As you know the economy of Aden is controlled almost exclusively by Dwarves.  Human traders were obliged to join together to overcome Dwarvish hegemony.<br>
I have recently been invited to join the guild but am hesitant to do so.  The Dwarves are formidable competitors...  Business is their very nature.   And the traders of Giran and Innadril have been at each other's throats until very recently...  Now I am to believe that they will cooperate with each other?  I think not! Of course, this is just my opinion.<br>
