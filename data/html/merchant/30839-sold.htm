When we pay cash for an item, we typically pay less than half of its retail value.  No, less than that...  Consequently many people choose to directly exchange items for things they need.  Obviously this can get quite complicated. If the item you're selling is inexpensive, it would be simpler to sell it to a store directly.<br>
