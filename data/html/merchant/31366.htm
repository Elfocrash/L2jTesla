<html><body>Feed Seller:<br>
Welcome! Ferocious animals are raised here! If you're lucky, you'll find that your animals obey you. If not... You'd be better off killing them before they kill you.<br>
I sell two types of feed for fierce animals: <font color="LEVEL">Gold Spice</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Crystal Spice</font>.<br>
The Gold Spice makes them fleshy while the Crystal Spice strengthens their bones and skin. Feed your animal the Gold Spice if you want it to look well-cared-for. Feed it the Crystal Spice if you want it to grow strong and powerful.<br>
If you're not sure which one to use, try both and compare. You'll spot the differences immediately.<br>
