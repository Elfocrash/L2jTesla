Ah, yes, the classes. There are many, almost too many to name. But I suppose I must, since it is my job.<br>
STR and CON and DEX combined together form one harmony.<br>
This harmony can be used by all classes.<br>
INT, WIT and MEN can generate a significantly negative effect if used improperly.<br>
Only those who belong to a few classes and have received special training can use this type of harmony!<br><br1>
INT and MEN can only be used by Wizards.<br>
INT and WIT can be used by anyone except Healers.<br>
MEN and WIT can be used by all Mystics.<br>
Does this make sense?<br><br1>
