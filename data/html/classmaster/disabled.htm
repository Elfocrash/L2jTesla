<html><body>Class Manager:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Nya~, this feature is currently disabled :3.</font><br><br>
If you see this panel, it means the server admin added manually a Class Manager, but kept the config <font color="LEVEL">AllowClassMasters</font> on <font color="LEVEL">"False"</font>.<br><br>
Consider first <font color="LEVEL">to delete all spawns of this character you eventually made</font>, then enable the option located in <font color="LEVEL">npcs.properties</font>. Once enabled, restart your server. It will automatically spawn 5 generic spawns of this NPC (on newbies villages). Add/remove spawns as you want, but for the best result, <font color="LEVEL">I invite you to turn on the config option</font>.<br><br>
