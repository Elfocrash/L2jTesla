Hi! Welcome!
A nice day for fishing, isn't it?<br>
My family has been active in the Fishermen's Guild for generations. My expertise brought me here, where I teach the aristocrats how to improve their fishing technique. Fishing here requires a lot of skill, and consequently, the best fishermen come here to pursue their hobby.<br>
