This harbor has been one of the most popular fishing areas in the Kingdom of Elmore since ancient times. As you can see, there aren't many ships, therefore the fish keep growing! Many of rare species found here are not found anywhere else!<br>
Remember, come and see Platis for all of your fishing needs!<br>
