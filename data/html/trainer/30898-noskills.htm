<html><body>Blacksmith Morning:<br>
What a nerve! Can't you see how busy I am? What with creating and selling my wares, how would I find the time to teach anyone?<br>
Wait, are you a Dwarf? Hmm... I see. If you're an Artisan or a Warsmith, I suppose I could spare enough time to give you a lesson... But it won't come cheap... Tell you what, give me 100 million adena and I will give you a special lesson while the Head Blacksmith is away...
