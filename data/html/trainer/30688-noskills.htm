How can someone so young be so forgetful! I'm a Dwarf and a blacksmith, you fool! I am not a Warehouse Keeper!<br>
You can stand around as long as you want, but I will never teach you anything about blacksmithing!<br>
...Oh, and  by the way, we don't sell anything here so just run along if there is something you want to buy.
