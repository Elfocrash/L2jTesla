<html><body>Magister Baulro:<br>
The Priest Yohanes is my elder twin brother. Originally, we both promised to follow the path of a Priest like our father, who was a bishop, but I was fascinated by magic and chose to walk the path of the Sorcerer instead. In the days when I wavered between the Sorcerer's life and the Priest's, my brother Yohanes encouraged me to choose the path I truly desired. He helped me become the person I am now. For that, I am very grateful to him.
