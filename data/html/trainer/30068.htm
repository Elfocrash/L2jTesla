<html><body>Priest Shegfield:<br>
Welcome to the Holy Temple of Einhasad. Like Priestess Glyvka, I was born and raised here in Dion Castle Town. At one time, I thought this land was cursed. The places outside of the castle and village are all very frightful, you see. However, I gave my devotion to Einhasad and afterwards my mind was at peace. Now I think this all was the will of the gods.<br>
