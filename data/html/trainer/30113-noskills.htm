<html><body>Magister Juris:<br>
May the tranquility of the still lakes be with you. I am Magister Juris and I teach magic to the Elves.<br>
I would like to share my knowledge with you, but unfortunately only Elven Mystics can understand my teachings. I'm sure there is someone who can teach you, if you search further.
