Some time ago , an Elemental Summoner that I had never seen befor came to see Annabel over there... She has been dating a former lord of Innadril for over 100 years. She is the same age as my great-great-grandmother! She must have a reason,although a romantic relationship between an Elf and a Human seems destined for trouble, don't you think...? How woruld you like seeing your lover wither and die while you stayed the same? Or the reverse!<br>
