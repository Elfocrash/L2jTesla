Ah, yes, Lich King Icarus! He's quite frightful at first sight, let me tell you! Since he's undead, he doesn't eat or sleep. His magic and knowledge of necromancy are unrivaled on the entire continent!<br>
Although he seems to be free, actually, he's always being invisibly restrained by Master Hardin. He's taught me some very valuable techniques!<br>
I think he'd probably teach us even if he weren't restrained... Of course I don't mean that he actually cares about us... Undead don't care about anything... But, there may be another reason...<br>
