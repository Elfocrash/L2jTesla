Elves have lived in Innadril since ancient days. Since around DE.1200, when Tetrach Terestien and his followers came here from Oren, they have been known as the "fairies of the lake". In those days, Humans and Elves intermarried freely. Elves blood flows through the veins of many residents of Innadril and therefore, the Humans in this area tend to live longer and be more attractive than elsewhere.<br>
