Did I not just warn you of the dangers of unrestrained curiosity?<br>
But then, it is something you will have to know eventually, so I will tell you everything you need to know. Have you heard of a magician named Hardin? He is an undead spirit who researches black magic forbidden by the commandments of the Ivory Tower.<br>
The magic of darkness leads to depravity and, eventually, destruction. Forbidden knowledge is dangerous even to the most casual touch. However, many talented magicians have been fooled by Hardin's tricks and have become his followers. You are not safe from his evil hand either, so always be cautious.<br>
