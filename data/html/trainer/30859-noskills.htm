<html><body>Priestess Vivyan:<br>
The philosophy of the god of light is evident in multitudes of daily occurrences. If you listen closely you can hear it in the songs of the birds and the insects, and see it in the mountains, fields and sky. Einhasad conveys her message to all, even those who serve different gods and live only for the next battle. You should find a master and listen closely to his words.
