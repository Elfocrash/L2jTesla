<html><body>Seer Takina:<br>
What do you think keeps a seer such as I here in this city of water, so greatly praised by Humans and Elves? How I long for the sound of the wild wind screeching against the wall of my beloved northern fortress...<br>
I have come here to warn those who believe that they are somehow protected from the chaos that swirls around them! Their peace and happiness shall soon be wrenched from them!<br>
Dear friends, you must prepare for the cold darkness ahead!<br>
