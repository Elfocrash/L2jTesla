<html><body>Prefect Marestella:<br>
I am prefect Marestella. I am the eye of the prefect of fire watching over Humans in theeir capital city. I came to Aden at the request of the king of the Humans.<br>
It is always refreshing to see humility in Humans but I am not sure that is what it is. We must beware of the wily Humans. They have terribly disappointed us in the past.<br>
