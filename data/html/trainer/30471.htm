I'm glad to see you today, young adventurer. Blacksmith Rupio of the Black Anvil Guild, at your service.<br>
My brother Pushkin and I are trying to make this shop the best blacksmith shop in all of Giran. We've been delayed getting started, just so you know. The tools we need from northern Dwarf village were delayed in arriving. But now everything is finally ship-shape! What can I do for you today?<br>
