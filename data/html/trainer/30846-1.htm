Ah, so you're interested in a Dual Sword? You've come to the right place, my friend! We can manufacture anything you need... uh, except for the A-Grades, thats is.<br>
Still, our weaponsmith skills are surpassed only by the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>!<br>
What's that? A Dual Sword Craft Stamp? No, no, you don't need one here -- we prefer not to entangle our customers with, uh... bureaucratic formalities.<br>
All we need from you are the weapons you wish us to combine and our modest, eminently reasonable fee: a Stone of Purity.<br>
Remember, though, weapons that have already had skills added to them cannot be combined. Also, once combined, the effect of Enchant will be lost.<br>
So, what kind of Dual Sword can we fashion for you today?<br>
