Attention! At ease!<br>
Welcome to the Orcs Guild at Hunters Village. I am Prefect Chakiris. I don't know if you will study under me or someone else, but please listen up and remember what I tell you. Shhh! You may move your arms. Open your ears and listen up.<br>
There are three things you must be aware of in the Hunters Village. First, Human or other creature, never underestimate them! Second, only go to the hunting grounds with someone you trust! Third, and most important... Take all orders from me, Prefect Chakaris!<br>
