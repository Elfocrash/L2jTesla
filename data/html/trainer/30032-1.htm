<html><body>Priest Yohanes:<br>
Einhasad, the goddess of light, is the mother of all good and the maker of Humans. Einhasad has always been the protector of justice, righteousness and goodness. Like our father, who became a bishop, my twin Baulro and I both serve Einhasad with all our hearts. Baulro is walking the path of a Sorcerer instead of a Priest, but his faith is no less than mine.
