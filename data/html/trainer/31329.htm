Oh, mighty Einhasad, guide us with your light...<br>
Ah! Hello! I was just praying...<br>
Have you visited the upper level of the temple? Honestly, my friend, that isn't really the place to learn the teachings of the Gods. Those teachings may only truly be learned within your heart. Times are extremely hard right now, but my faith in Einhasad is unchanged! Will you pray with me?<br>
