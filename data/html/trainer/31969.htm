Horeum penesto domapio... Oh, pardom me! I didn't see you there. There haven't been any legitimate Wizards in Schuttgart for years! The nearest teacher of magic are in Gludio.<br>
As I'm sure you know, it's a long way to Gludio! Every time I've made the journey, I just immerse myself in arcane study! I was there recently, actually. In fact, I was just reviewing what I had learned!<br>
