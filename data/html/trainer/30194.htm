I have traveled the world over but there is one thing I will never understand. Why do Humans tremble so at the thought of Black Magic? The mere words are enough to fill their hearts with terror!<br>
I find it unfathomable that a being who can face down spears and swords and use betrayal and cunning tricks so effortlessly is frightened of something so natural!<br>
However they do seem to be up to something. Perhaps there is a room hidden in the Ivory Tower which teaches Black Magic...?<br>
