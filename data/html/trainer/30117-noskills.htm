<html><body>Priest Primos:<br>
Traveler, welcome to the temple of light! The doors here are always open to those who wish to meditate on Einhasad's will.<br>
However, the magic of light that the priests teach here cannot be taught to just anyone. Only Mystics of Human birth, and among them only those who seek divine truth, can receive lessons here.
