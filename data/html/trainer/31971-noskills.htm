<html><body>Magister Otillo:<br>
You still want to learn magic from me after all you've seen? If you still trust me, I'll teach you, but I can't do anything without my magic staff! I'm a bit stiff at the moment, and I can't hold it in my mounth! Ha! no, this won't work at all! You must find another magician whose body is still intact!
