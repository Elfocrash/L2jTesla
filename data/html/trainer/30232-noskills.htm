<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Sorint:<br>
I will safeguard anyone's property. If a unicorn was to walk in and ask me to keep his horn I would gladly add him to the account book. However, I will not teach skills merely for money.<br>
...If I teach our secrets, we Dwarven Artisans will be out of our jobs! We can learn from the foolish Elves, who taught magic to the Humans only to be stabbed in the back.
