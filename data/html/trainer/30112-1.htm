<html><body>Magister Maurius:<br>
The evil that oppresses us is none other than the green dragon Antharas. It nests in the deepest part of the Dragon Valley. My brother Juris and I teach magic to our Elven brothers in the guild here, but we are also charged with the task of keeping watch on Antharas' movements.<br>
If Antharas erupts again, the surrounding land will be covered with destruction and death. Therefore, we cannot be lazy about precautions.<br>
