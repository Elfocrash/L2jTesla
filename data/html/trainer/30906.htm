<html><body>Priest Ranton:<br>
Have you heard the story of Devil's Isle? It is said that the ghost of the great pirate Zaken haunts that forlorn island to this very day... He foolishly sought immortality and got more than he bargained for.Ha! All who have gone there in search of his lost treasure have perished,may Einhasad have mercy on their souls. This has caused great distress in our temple...<br>
Oh, well, I'm sure from the look in your eyes that my warnings are falling on deaf ears. You, like so many others, are called to that wicked place like moths to the flame!<br>
Heed my words! A corpse shouldn't be prepared for burial at night. Under the bright of Einhasad, all unclean things are burnt to ashes and blow away.<br>
