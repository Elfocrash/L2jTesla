Since ancient times, the people of Elmore have nurtured and venerated the military arts... and not just the residents! The Einhasad Temple of Goddard shares a building with the Warrior guild, and has even given them their full support!<br>
Naturally, this doesn't mean that we endorse violence! But history has taught us that in order to maintain peace and harmony, we must keep our military strong.<br>
