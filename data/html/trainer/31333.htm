Indeed, I'm constantly amazed by the Humans' desire to write down everything they think of! I suppose it's due to other inadequate memories...<br>
I suppose, if I have the time, it wouldn't hurt to read these books... But what if new books arrive before I finish reading these? Is there a magic skill that will let me read faster?<br>
