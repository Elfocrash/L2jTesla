This is obviously not your average country store! Here we combine high quality weapons to make dualswords.<br>
Although we are quite skilled, occasionally there are weapons that are beyond our abilities... In that case, you might try<font color="LEVEL"> a shop in the capital city, or look for the Blacksmith of Mammon.</font> You never know... Maybe some hermit could help you!<br>
The Trade Guild, in order to prevent over-production of these powerful weapons, has set a strict quota on the number that may be created.<br>
Each territory is allotted only a small number of certificates that allow the manufacture of a dualsword.<br>
If you can manage to obtain one of these documents, bring it to me, along with the two swords you wish to combine, and I'll make an awesome weapon for you!<br>
Remember, weapons that have had skills added to them may not be combined.<br>
Would you like to see the list of dualswords I can create for you?<br>
