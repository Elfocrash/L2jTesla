To the north of this village is a massive ravine. That place is a gathering place for dragons such as worms or drakes; so it was named the Dragon Valley.<br>
Many hunters desiring a worm's scales or a drake's claw rashly venture into that valley, only to lose their lives. That is because the green dragon Antharas has summoned malignant spirits to protect its home.<br>
If you are thinking of going there, you must be especially careful.<br>
