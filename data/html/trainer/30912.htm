Recently the streets have been swaming with doomsayers, most babbling something about the return of Shillen. I wouldn't be surprised to find that renegade forces within the temple were behind all this.<br>
Although all Dark Elves have at the least a deep respect for Shillen, these false prophets are most assuredly not endoresed by the elders. They are just rabble-rouserswho need to be 'taught a lesson'...<br>
I must admit that my weapons skill is lacking, but I do have some other skills you might find interesting...<br>
