<html><body>Blacksmith Pinter:<br>
Welcome! How can I help you? Go ahead, ask me anything, I'm a 3rd generation blacksmith and a proud Dwarf. You won't find a Dwarf in these parts with a fuller beard, on that I'll stake my shop! I'm also a master of my profession, if I do say so myself. So don't be shy -- ask away!<br>
