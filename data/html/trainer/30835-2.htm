Ah yes, Hardin... I've spent much time with him... But I still don't know much about him... Often he leaves the academy and stays away for a long time. I have no idea where he goes or what he does. He must be working on something fantastic...<br>
He's rather urbane by Human standards, but he actually doesn't consider niceties to be important. Not even as important as a single strand of an undead's hair! People like him have no respect for laws, rules or ethics...<br>
