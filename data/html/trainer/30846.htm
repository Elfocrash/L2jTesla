<html><body>Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>
Oh-ho-ho! If you thought we blacksmiths are only good ror making armor, swords, spears, axes and plows, you're making a big mistake, my friend. See Aden Castle over there, brooding over everything as though it were invulnerable to harm? Believe you me, it would be no more than heap of rubble if not for the efforts of artisans of the Black Anvil Guild.<br>
Softly, now... Folk are even saying that the gigantic golem used during the riots to expel the human lords was created by the Black Anvil guild. axes and ploughs, indeed! I can't confirm that, of course, but who other than the Black Anvil Guild could fashion such a terrible, wondrous creation? Don't you agree?<br>
