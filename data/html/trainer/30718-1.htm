Mystics are commonly described as cold and unfeeling, however in reality that is not true... Magic is basically a knowledge of controlling infinite power. Most Mystics treat it with respect. But occasionally a Mystic becomes arrogant, one way or another, and tragedy inevitably> follows. We have seen a few examples, have we not?<br>
Mystics are by no means coldhearted. Rather, they are people with radical personalities, people who would sell their souls to the devil in order to achieve their goal. Yes, without this characteristic it is hard for one to be a successful Mystic.<br>
Me? Hmmm. I'm not sure...
