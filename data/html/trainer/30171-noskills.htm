I have nothing to teach you. Maybe you'll find who you're looking for upstairs? Even though Gauen is younger than other Elves, he is a fine teacher. Kaiena is quite hard to deal with but is a great Mystic.<br>
This place has no teachings for Clerics so, if you are one, I suggest you look for the temple.
