<html><body>Master Goldian:<br>
The swordsmanship that I teach can only be learned by the grace and delicacy of an Elven Fighter. It is not suited to Humans, with their clumsy hand movements, or Orcs with their stiff shoulders. Of course, it goes without saying that Mystics, who lack even the most basic sword techniques, will find it too difficult.<br>
Go find a teacher that is appropriate for you.
