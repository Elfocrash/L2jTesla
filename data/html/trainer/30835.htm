<html><body>Lich King Icarus:<br>
I've not seen your face before...what a fresh and lively one it is! I like it; I think I like you! Perhaps you will permit me to look inside you, hmmm...<br>
What a charming look of surprise! Wonderful! Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Icarus. Long ago, when I was still mortal, I bore another name, but I no longer remember it... In the time of Elmoreden, you know, there were 13 lich kings who ruled the kingdom. Ha ha ha!<br>
