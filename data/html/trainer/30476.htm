<html><body>Magister Kaira:<br>
A pleasure to meet you, Mystic of darkness. I see you have journeyed quite far from the Elven Forest. The Hierarchs remain well, I presume?<br>
I reside here and teach magic to the Dark Elven people who journey to this place. In my moments of leisure, I receive their assistance in tracking down old remains or forgotten relics. You never know, I might be able to find a clue to the lost black magic of the giants of ere.<br>
