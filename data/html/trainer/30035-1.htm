Ah, I made a slip of the tongue! Priest Petron is actually my elder twin brother. Unlike me, he is always calm and quiet. Ah, you asked what the Twins Temple means, didn't you? Well, here Yohanes and Baulro are twins, and so are Potter and I. It may be a coincidence, but the village people joke that the temple is the Twins Temple.<br>
By the way, they don't talk that way around High Priest Biotin. He dislikes it when people make jokes about this holy temple. Anyway, does that answer your question?
