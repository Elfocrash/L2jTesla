Oh, hello. I think the beauty of Gludio is second only to that of the Elven Forest. I also like this place because it's right next to the ocean... When I feel stifled, I just look out at the sea. Is there anything I can do for you? Since I am in a good mood today, I feel like I could do anything.<br>
