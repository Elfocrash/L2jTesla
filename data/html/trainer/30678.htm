Who are you? What's you business here? Unless you brought me a cold mug of Dawarf beer, I'm in no mood for visitors.<br>
Arggh! Heat it, hit it, bend it cool it, Those are the fundamentals... But how do I start there and finish with armor strong enough to withstand a Giant's fist, or a blade sharp enough to cut the wind itself?<br>
Ah, perfection is a harsh mistress! What brings you here, then?<br>
