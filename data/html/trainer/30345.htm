<html><body>Magister Ramoniell:<br>
In the morning I must organize the magic materials and do the cleaning, and in the afternoon I must lecture in "Basic Understanding of Magic". In the evening, I have to study magic to improve my own skills and meditate. Can't you see how busy I am? So please, just get to your point quickly.<br>
