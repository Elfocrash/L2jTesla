Welcome! If you want to learn how to kill Humans you are at the right place! Cut off their heads,beat them to death; there are a million ways to do it and wherever you go it's always the same! Even in lovely-sounding places such as this, "the city of the goddess of water".Everyone in on their best behavior here, but step outside the gates even an inch and POW! Off comes your head! Or you get a knife stuck through you neck! Dark Elves are aware of these dangers. It neverceases to amaze me how different the children of the same goddess are from each other...<br>
