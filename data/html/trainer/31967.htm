Good tidings to you! An Elf's delicate appearance belies his true prowess! We may look weak, but our strengh is without peer or measure! Our power flows freely, like a river which carves through living rock!<br>
You must learn to tap this power, as you would dig a well. But how you focus that power is entirely up to you!<br>
