I hope that your faith is consistent, as is the brilliance of <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad,</font> the goddess of light. Welcome to the temple of Einhasad. Won't you put yourself in Einhasad's hands and walk the path of her righteousness? Just like my father, a famous bishop, I am also walking that road. What have you come looking for?<br>
