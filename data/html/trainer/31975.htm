Darkness has always been the realm of the Dark Elves... or has it? What if that was just the propaganda of those snobbish Elves? Think on it!<br>
After all, it is because of them them the whole world believes we belong in the shadows!<br>
They use their fair skin and disarming smiles to charm and persuade, but it is a facade! We Dark Elves must never ignore the snide hatred that lurks behind their pretentious smiles!<br>
