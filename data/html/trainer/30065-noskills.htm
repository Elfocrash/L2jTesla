<html><body>Master Arnelle:<br>
I see someone has been spreading strange rumors. Look here, I have no time for you. Do you think my precious time is yours to waste? I am busy enough teaching those who come to me. Why don't you get out of my sight? On busy days like these, I don't have time to fool around. Go out and find a Master who suits your class before I drive you off!
