<html><body>Magister Roa:<br>
Welcome to the Hall of Magic. My fellow Magisters and I are dispatched from Oren's Ivory Tower to instruct seekers of wisdom here in Giran.<br>
I am sorry, but I cannot initiate you in the magic of the Ivory Tower. Only those of Human birth and with basic magic skills can take my classes. I'm afraid you must go.
