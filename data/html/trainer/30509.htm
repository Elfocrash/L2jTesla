You came to the right place.<br>
Fighters like you should always train hard and be ready to sacrifice anything at any time for the Orcs.<br>
First, to learn skills, you need experience. I cannot simply explain to you how to be a great Fighter, you must actually experience the situations I teach you about.<br>
Once you have the needed experience and learn from my words, then those skills will be yours. Now, consider your ability and select a skill that you want to learn.<br>
