Welcome to the Hall of Magic. My fellow Sorcerers and I are dispatched from the Ivory Tower to instruct seekers of wisdom here in Giran.<br>
I see you are from a country school. Perhaps you studied at Einhovant's School of Wizardry? I wonder if you really learned the basics in such a remote place... I'm a little worried that you may not be able to keep up with my teaching.<br>
Shall we begin? If there is anything you don't understand, don't feel embarrassed and always ask.<br>
