<html><body>Master Wandius:<br>
The Fighters Guild here in the town of Dion is very strict. This may be because of the surrounding regions. To the north lies the Cruma Marshlands and the Horseshoe Mountains. To the east are the Execution Grounds, dyed with the blood of Humans.<br>
If you have the confidence to endure the strict training, you may be up to the challenge. It is a natural law that things which are obtained with difficulty are not easily lost.<br>
