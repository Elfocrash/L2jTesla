The blood of the wolf flows through our tribe, the Atuba. wolves are our brothers and the guardian spirits that protect us, and we have taken their symbol for our own.<br> 
You will recognize other orc tribes by their own symbols: the Hestui tribe is 'gray bear,'the Neruga tribe is 'bat,'the Urutu is 'Orc's skull,' the Dudamara is 'spider,' and the Gandi tribe is 'monster's eye.'<br>
