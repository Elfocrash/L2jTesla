<html><body>Gatekeeper Minerva:<br>
Hardin's Academy is not a place for sightseers. Do you know what a Necromancer is? To them, body parts of people are nothing more than ingredients for their magic... Their grisly crimes surpass those of the Dark Elves... Such is the fate that awaits you at Hardin's Academy.<br>
Does this frighten you? If you wish to leave this evil place I will send you as far as you want instantaneously.<br>
