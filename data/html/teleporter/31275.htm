<html><body>Gatekeeper Tatiana:<br>
Hello! Pleased to meet you. I'm Tatiana, a gatekeeper of the Town of Goddard. I control a gate of time and space, which allows people to travel instantly to remote places! If you want to learn how to operate it, you must study at the Ivory Tower for a long time, as I did.<br>
Now, where would you like to go?<br>
