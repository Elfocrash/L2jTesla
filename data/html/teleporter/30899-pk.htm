Gatekeeper Flauen:<br>
Oh my! You murderer! Surely you couldn't have intentionally done such a heinous act!<br>
You will not easily remove the stain of innocent blood from your hands... You have perhaps only one chance of redemption... Seek your penance in the company of other sinners...<br>
I pray one day that your heart will once again be light and carefree in this beautiful city...
