Here's the coupon you requested. You're now eligible to rent a weapon from the Adventurer's Guild warehouse. This coupon is non-transferable, and you are responsible for any damages or loss of weaponry.<br>
You may only rent one weapon at a time, and if at any time before you reach level 25 you become unhappy with your choice, you may turn in the weapon for another coupon. Good luck!
