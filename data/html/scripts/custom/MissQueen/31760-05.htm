<html><body>Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:<br>
Have you enjoyed your adventure so far? Here is the weapon exchange coupon for travelers.<br>
This coupon allows you to receive a grade D weapon from the warehouse of the Adventurer's Guild. The coupon is non-transferable, and you are responsible for any loss or damage of it or the weapon.<br>
You may only rent one weapon at a time, and if at any time before you reach level 25 you become unhappy with your choice, you may turn in the weapon for another coupon. Good luck!
