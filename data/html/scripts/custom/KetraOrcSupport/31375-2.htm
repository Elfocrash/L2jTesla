Tejakar Ketra! Welcome, dear friend!<br>
I've been ordered to supply a higher-level pouch to you, but you won't get the strongest armor yet! Try again when you've had more experiences.<br>
Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Buffalo Horn</font> and I'll give you whatever you want. Care to take a look?<br>
