<html><body>Ketra's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
The Silenos were a wandering tribe that followed the wind. I suppose if you've made it this far you already know that. We Varka are warriors! We're the toughest, most tenacious fighters ever! You're extremely brave!<br>
You helped us to drive those arrogant Ketra Orcs from our territory!<br>
Dear friend of the Varka, please stay and help us fight our enemy!<br>
