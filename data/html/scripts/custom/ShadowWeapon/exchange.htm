A Shadow Weapon is a special weapon that is made in cooperation between the Ivory Tower and the Black Anvil Guild. It is created by magically projecting the power of a weapon onto another catalytic object. While that means that it can only be used while the magic charge remains, it has made it possible to mass produce projectile weapons.<br>
Its performance is no different than if you used the original weapon, except that it cannot possess the special ability to absorb souls or refine through a Stone of Life. Also, although it acts as a weapon, it is actually in the magic category -- once opened, it cannot be passed on to someone else. Consider it an aid on your new path until you lay your hands on some real weapons.<br>
