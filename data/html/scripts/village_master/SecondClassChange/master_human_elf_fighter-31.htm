Gladiators typically shun heavy armor and excel in hand-to-hand combat. They are among the strongest non-magical characters, carrying blades in both hands and having the capability of strong, repeated slashings.<br>
To become a Gladiator your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Duelist.<br>
