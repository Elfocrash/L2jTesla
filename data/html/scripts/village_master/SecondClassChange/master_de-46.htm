In order to be a Spellhowler your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Magus.<br>
Obviously your level is not high enough and you don't have all of the marks. Come back after doing this and I will change your occupation to Spellhowler.
