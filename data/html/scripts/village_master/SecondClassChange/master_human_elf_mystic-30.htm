To become a Necromancer your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
Obviously your skill level is not high enough and you have not collected all the marks. Return when you have done this and I will change your occupation to Necromancer.
