To become a Tyrant your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Duelist.<br>
Obviously you lack the marks and the skills to advance. Come back when you have collected all 3 marks and completed the necessary training and I will change your occupation to Tyrant.
