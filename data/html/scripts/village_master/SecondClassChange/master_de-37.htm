Congratulations! You have at last become an Shillien Elder of the proud Dark Elves! It may take some getting used to, but don't worry. You will soon start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
Remember to always carry yourself with the dignity befitting your position. May you carry the awesome power of Shilen with you always.
