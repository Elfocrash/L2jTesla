To become a Treasure Hunter your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
Obviously your skills need improvement and you have not collected the necessary marks.<br>
Didn't I make myself clear on the requirements for this occupation earlier? Come back after collecting the marks and increasing your level above 40. Then I shall change your occupation to Treasure Hunter.
