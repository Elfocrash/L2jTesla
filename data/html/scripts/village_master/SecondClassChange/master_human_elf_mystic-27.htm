To become a Sorcerer your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Magus.<br>
I see that you have all the marks, but you still require more training. Return when you have advanced your skill level and I will change your occupation to Sorcerer.
