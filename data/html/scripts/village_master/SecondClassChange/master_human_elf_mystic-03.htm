Spellsingers are somewhat similar to Human Sorcerers, but with Elven sensibilities. They practice a potent form of elemental magic. Very fast during combat and more efficient and safe than other Mystics. Most dreaded opponent during a siege.<br>
To become a Spellsinger, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Magus.<br>
