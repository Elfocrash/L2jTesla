To become an Overlord your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Lord.<br>
I see that you have collected all 3 marks, but lack the training to advance. Come back when you have completed your training and I will advance your occupation to Overlord.
