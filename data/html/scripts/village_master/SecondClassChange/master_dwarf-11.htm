To become a Bounty Hunter your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
Your training is impressive but you do not have the required marks. Return to me when you have the marks and I will advance your occupation to Bounty Hunter.
