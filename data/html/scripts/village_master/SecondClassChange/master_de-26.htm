To be a Shillien Knight, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
Obviously your level is not high enough and you haven't yet collected all of the marks. Come back when you have done this and I will change your occupation to Shillien Knight.
