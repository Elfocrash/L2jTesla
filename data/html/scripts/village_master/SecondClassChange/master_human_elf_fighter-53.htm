To become a Treasure Hunter your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Searcher. I see that you have all the marks but your skill level is still insufficient. Come back after more training and I shall change your occupation to Treasure Hunter.
