In order to be a Phantom Ranger your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.<br>
I see that you have all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back after more training and I will change your occupation to Phantom Ranger.
