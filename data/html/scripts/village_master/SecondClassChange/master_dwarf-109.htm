To become a Bounty Hunter your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
Obviously you do not have the marks or the requisite skills to advance. Come back when you have the marks and the training and I will advance your occupation to Bounty Hunter.
