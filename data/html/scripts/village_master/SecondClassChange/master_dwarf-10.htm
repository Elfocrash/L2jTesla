To become a Bounty Hunter your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
You have all the marks, but still lack the required training. Return to me when you have completed more training and I will advance your occupation to Bounty Hunter. Keep up the good work, young one.
