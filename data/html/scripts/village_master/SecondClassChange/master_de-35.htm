In order to be a Shillien Elder your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br>
I see that you have all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Get some more training and come back. Then I will change your occupation to Shillien Elder.
