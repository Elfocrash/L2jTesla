To become a Plainswalker your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Searcher.<br>
I see that you have all the marks but your skill level is still insufficient. Come back after more training and I shall change your occupation to Plainswalker.
