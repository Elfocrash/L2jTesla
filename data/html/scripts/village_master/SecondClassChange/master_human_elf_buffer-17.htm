To become a Bishop your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Healer.<br>
Obviously you lack training even though you have all the marks. Come back to me when you have done more training and I will change your occupation to Bishop.
