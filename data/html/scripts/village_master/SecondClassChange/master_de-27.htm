In order to be a Shillien Knight your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
Obviously you have all of the marks but your level is not high enough. Come back after more training and I will change your occupation to Shillien Knight.
