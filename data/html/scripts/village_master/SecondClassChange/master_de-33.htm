Congratulations! You have at last become a Bladedancer of the proud Dark Elves! It may take time to get accustomed to your new occupation, but you will soon start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
May your dignity and devotion to Shilen remain strong always. You must never stop learning. Congratulations again on becoming a Bladedancer!
