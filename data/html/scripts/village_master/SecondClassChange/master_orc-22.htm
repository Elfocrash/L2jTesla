To become a Destroyer your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Challenger, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Champion.<br>
Your training is impressive but you still have not collected all 3 marks. Return to me when you get the marks and I will advance your occupation to Destroyer.
