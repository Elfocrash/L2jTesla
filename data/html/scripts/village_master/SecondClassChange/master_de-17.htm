The Phantom Ranger is somewhat similar to the Human Hawkeye and the Elven Silver Ranger, but the Phantom's evasion skills and hit rate are superior. Very strong offense and most feared during sieges, they lack stamina.<br>
They have strong archery skills such as strengthening bows and shooting several arrows simultaneously.<br>
To be a Phantom Ranger, your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.<br>
