In order to be a Shillien Knight your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.<br>
Your level is adequate but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all of the marks and I will change your occupation to Shillien Knight.
