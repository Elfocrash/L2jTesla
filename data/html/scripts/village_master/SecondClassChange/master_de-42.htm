In order to be a Phantom Ranger your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.<br>
Obviously your level is not high enough and you don't have all of the marks. Come back when you have done this and I will change your occupation to Phantom Ranger.
