In order to be a Shillien Elder your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br>
Obviously your level is not high enough and you haven't collected all of the marks. Come back after you do this and I will change your occupation to Shillien Elder.
