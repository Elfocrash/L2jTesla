To become an Overlord your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Lord.<br>
Obviously you lack the marks and the skills to advance. Come back when you have collected all 3 marks and completed the necessary training and I will change your occupation to Overlord.
