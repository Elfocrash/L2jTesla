To become a Sorcerer your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Magus.<br>
Your skills are impressive but you still must collect all of the required marks. Return to me when you have the marks and I will change your occupation to Sorcerer.
