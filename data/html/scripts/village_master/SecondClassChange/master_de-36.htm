In order to be a Shillien Elder your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.<br>
Your level is adequate but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all of the marks and I will change your occupation to Shillien Elder.
