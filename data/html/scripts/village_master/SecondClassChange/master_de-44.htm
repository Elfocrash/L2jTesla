In order to be a Phantom Ranger your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.<br>
Your level is adequate but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all of the marks and I will change your occupation to Phantom Ranger.
