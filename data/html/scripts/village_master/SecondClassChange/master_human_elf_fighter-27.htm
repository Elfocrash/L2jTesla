A Silver Ranger is similar to a Human Hawkeye, But his evasion and hit rate are superior. He is most dreaded during Siege Battle. Even a Paladin cannot outlast an attack by a group of them.<br>
Their archery skills include strengthening their bows and shooting several arrows simultaneously.<br>
To become a Silver Ranger your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.<br>
