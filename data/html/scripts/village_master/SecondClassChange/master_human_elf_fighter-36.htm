To become a Temple Knight your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer. Obviously your skills need improvement and you have not collected the necessary marks.<br>
Didn't I make myself clear on the requirements for this occupation earlier? Come back after collecting the marks and increasing your level above 40. Then I shall change your occupation to Temple Knight.
