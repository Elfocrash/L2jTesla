A D-Grade armor acquisition quest is available exclusively for Academy members. At graduation, members also receive an Academy Circlet as a reward.<br>
An existing clan member can be appointed as an Academy member's sponsor. sponsors can view whether the academy member is logged in, as well as assist the member during the armor acquistion quest.<br>
Academy members may wear the D-Grade armor only while still a member.<br>
