<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
I regret to say, my child, that you haven't met the requirements. You should speak with <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">temple in Gludin Village</font>. Collect proof of the four elements and obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>. Only then will I promote you to Wizard.
