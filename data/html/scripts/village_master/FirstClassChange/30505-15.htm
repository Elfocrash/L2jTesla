<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
Basically, to qualify as a Monk, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Monk yet. To take the Test of the Monk, go to the Orc named <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.
