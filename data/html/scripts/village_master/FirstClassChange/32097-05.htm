Orc Monks are priests who worship Pa'agrio, the God of Fire. To become one, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
If you want to take the test, go see <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu in the Orc Village</font>. He was once a great Orc Monk himself, and now teaches young Orcs the way of martial combat. Pass his test and bring me the proof, and I'll promote you to Orc Monk.<br>
