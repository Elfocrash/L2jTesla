<html><body>Grand Master Tobias:<br>
To become a Palus Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Palus Knight, as well.<br>
However, it seems your level is not high enough, and you have not passed the test, either. First, raise your level to 20 or higher. Also, seek <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font> of our guild to take the Test of the Palus Knight. You can change profession to Palus Knight only after you take his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">gaze of the abyss</font> as proof.
