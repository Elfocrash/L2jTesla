You need the appropriate level and token to become a Cleric. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Cleric, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Cleric.<br>
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the test. You will be acknowledged as a true Cleric only when you have proved your faith in the Test of the Cleric. <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt</font> of our temple is in charge of making that determination. He will test your faith. To change profession to become a Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font> as proof.
