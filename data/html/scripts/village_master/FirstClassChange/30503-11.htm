<html><body>Warehouse Chief Rikadio:<br>
I am the Warehouse Chief Rikadio of the Iron Gate Guild. I am a respected Dwarf who teaches Dwarven Fighters and Scavengers.<br>
What has brought you to me? Surely you didn't come to me because you thought you could learn something from me, did you? With the slow minds of your race, you cannot catch up with the Dwarves' economic abilities, commercial sense, or keen understanding of money. Now that you know, go back to your sword fighting or haughty magic, or whatever it is you people do.
