<font color="LEVEL">Clerics</font> use the sacred energy which permeates our world to perform their magic. They prefer to help others by using White and Support Magic, but are capable of defending themselves should they come under attack.<br>
Clerics value self-sacrifice, and are excellent healers. Hence, they're welcomed and respected wherever they go. They can eventually become <font color="LEVEL">Bishops</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Prophets</font>.<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must possess an unwaivering faith. They can prove their fidelity by bringing me a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font>.<br>
