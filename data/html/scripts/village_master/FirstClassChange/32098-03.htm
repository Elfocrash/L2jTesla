<font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizards</font> can commune with spirits more deeply, and thereby cast more powerful magic. They are one level higher than Elven Mages and can use Elemental Magic, Dark Magic and Summon Magic. Elven Wizards possess strong magic powers that allow them to attack their enemies by commanding fire and wind at will, or to use their dark power to take away their opponent's life. They can also summon the spirits that dwell in nature in the form of "servitors" to attack their enemies.<br>
Among Elven Wizards, those who possess the ability to raise their elemental magic to the highest limit will follow the path of a <font color="LEVEL">Spellsinger</font>, and those who achieve ultimate mastery of summoning magic will walk the path of an <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Summoner</font>.<br>
In order to become an Elven Wizard, you must bring back the mark called <font color="LEVEL">Eternity Diamond</font>. If you have this mark, you can transfer to the Elven Wizard class.<br>
