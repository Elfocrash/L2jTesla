To meet the qualifications to become an Shaman, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Shaman.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Shaman yet. To take the test, go to <font color="LEVEL">Tataru Zu Hestui of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.
