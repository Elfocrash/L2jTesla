<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
I regret to say, my child, that you haven't met the requirements. You should speak with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt at the temple in Gludin Village</font>. Pass his test and then bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font>.
