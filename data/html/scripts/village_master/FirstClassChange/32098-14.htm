Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must bring me the Mark of Faith as a proof of their fidelity. <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt</font> can provide you with further details.<br>
Find him in the temple in the northeastern part of Gludin Village. Do as he says and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font> that he gives you in return. I shall then grant you Cleric status.<br>
