The <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss</font> is given only to those who have passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the Test of the Shillien Oracle, you should find <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Sidra</font> in the Dark Elven Guild of the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. As you well know, the town of Gludio is to the northwest. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is the easiest way to get there. The Dark Elven Guild is in the northeastern part of the village.<br>
