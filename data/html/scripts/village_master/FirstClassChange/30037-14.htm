To become a Cleric, one's faith must be verified. I always leave the judgement in this matter in the hands of <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt</font>, who has devout faith. I suggest you speak to Priest Zigaunt here in our temple. To change profession to Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">mark of faith</font> as proof.<br>
