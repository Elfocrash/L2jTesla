<font color="LEVEL">Monks</font> are priests who devote themselves to the path of flame. Unlike Raiders, they do not rely on swords or large weapons, but use their own bodies as weapons of war. Because they do not depend on weapons or armor, they learn many skills to protect themselves.<br>
The finest Monks are selected to become <font color="LEVEL">Tyrants</font>, for still more advanced physical and technical training.<br>
