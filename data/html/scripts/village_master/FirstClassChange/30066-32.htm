To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession. To become a Knight, you need a token to prove that you passed the Test of the Human Knight, in addition to an appropriate level.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you did not pass the Test of the Human Knight. You can only be accepted as a true Knight when you pass the test. If you want to know more about the test, visit <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font>, who is one of the high-level Knights in the <font color="LEVEL"> village of Gludin</font>. He can be found near the fighter guild of Gludin. You can change profession to Knight if you pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">sword of ritual</font>.
