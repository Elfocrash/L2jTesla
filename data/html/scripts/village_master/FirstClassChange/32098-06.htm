<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oracles</font> are Mystics who control light, life and purifying spirits through the grace of Eva and Einhasad. They are highly-valued by other Elves for their spiritual insight. They are experts in White and Support Magics, and while their sense of devotion is similar to the Clerics, they are much faster.<br>
The most powerful Oracles are chosen to be <font color="LEVEL">Elders</font>. Elders are Oracles with awesome and unparalleled control of White Magic, and are particularly blessed by Einhasad and Eva.<br>
All who wish to become Oracles must bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font>.<br>
