You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Wizard, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br>
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the test. You will be accepted as a true Wizard only when you have passed the test. The Test of the Human Wizard requires gathering the tokens of the four elements. Visit <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> in our sanctuary to learn more about collecting the tokens. To change profession to become a Wizard, you should bring back the <font color="LEVEL">bead of four seasons</font> which you will receive when you have all four tokens.
