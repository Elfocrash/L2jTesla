<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
To become an Elven Ranger, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Elven Ranger, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Elven Ranger. You can become an Elven Ranger only if you pass the Test of the Elven Ranger. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Master Reisa at the town of Gludio</font> about the Test of the Elven Ranger. To become an Elven Ranger, you must pass her test and bring back her letter of recommendation.
