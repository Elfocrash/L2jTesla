You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Wizard, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Human Wizard. The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20. Also, you must gather the tokens of the four elements for the test. Visit <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> in our sanctuary to learn more about collecting the tokens. To change profession to become a Wizard, you should bring back the <font color="LEVEL">bead of four seasons</font> which you will receive when you have all four tokens.
