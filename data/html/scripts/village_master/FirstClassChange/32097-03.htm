Orc Raiders are a major force of the Orc race. To become one, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Orc Raider test.<br>
Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia in the Orc Village</font> to find out more about the test. He was once a great Orc Warrior, and now teaches young Orcs the ways of war. Pass his test and bring me the proof, and I'll promote you Orc Raider!<br>
