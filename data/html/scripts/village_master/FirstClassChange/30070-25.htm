<html><body>High Priest Sylvain:<br>
You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Wizard, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Human Wizard.<br>
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the Test of the Human Wizard. You will be accepted as a true Wizard only when you have passed the test. <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font>, who studies elemental magic at the temple in the <font color="LEVEL">village of Gludin</font>, can tell you about the test in detail. You must attain the <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Four Seasons</font>, which she will give you when you have collected the tokens for all four elements.
