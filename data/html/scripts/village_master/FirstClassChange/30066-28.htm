<html><body>Grand Master Pabris:<br>
To become a Warrior, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession. To become a Warrior, you need the <font color="LEVEL">medallion of the Warrior</font> to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well as an appropriate level.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you have not yet passed the Test of the Warrior. You will only be accepted as a true Warrior after you pass the test. Go ask <font color="LEVEL">Master Aymus in the village of Gludin</font> about the Test of the Warrior.
