<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
I am the High Prefect Drikus, heir to the authority of the eternal father of fire, Pa'agrio, and one who endeavors to revive the glory of the Orcs by teaching them. Could one like you dare to usurp the power of our race? We Orcs are the strongest race to walk the land. The likes of you could never even think of catching up to us.
