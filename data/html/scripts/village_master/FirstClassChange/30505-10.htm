<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
To become an Raider, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Raider, as well.<br>
it seems that you have passed the Test of the Raider, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even though you have a token. Come back when you have increased your level.
