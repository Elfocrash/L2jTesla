<html><body>Head Blacksmith Mendio:<br>
I am Head Blacksmith Mendio of the Black Anvil Guild. The Black Anvil Guild is a proud guild that produces Dwarven Fighters and Artisans. Without the skills of the Black Anvil Guild, you would be holding clubs carved from wood instead of those fine weapons. You want to learn the skills and secrets of our guild? Not a chance! Now you've been told, so go out and kills some poor monster or something.
