<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
You need the appropriate level and token to become an Oracle. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become an Elven Oracle, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Elven Oracle.<br>
However, it seems your level is lower than 20, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Elven Oracle. The first thing you need to do is train harder to reach level 20. Then you must pass the Test of the Elven Oracle and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">leaf of the Oracle</font> as proof. <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel</font> of our temple, who has taught us Elven Oracles for a long time, is in charge of the Test of the Oracle. If you want to know more about the test, speak to Priest Manuel. That's him, right over there.
