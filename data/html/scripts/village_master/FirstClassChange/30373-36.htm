<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
To become a Rogue, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Rogue, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Rogue. You can only be accepted as a true Rogue when you pass the test. Seek <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bezique</font> to take the test. He is at the entrance to the harbor on the west side of the village. To become a Rogue, pass his test and bring back his recommendation.
