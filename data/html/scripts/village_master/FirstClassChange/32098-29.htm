<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Cleric must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
Your level seems sufficient, but you still haven't passed the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt at the temple in Gludin Village</font>. Pass his test and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Faith</font>. Then I'll transfer you to Cleric.
