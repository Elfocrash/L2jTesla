<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
May I help you? I cannot teach anyone except those who aspire to discern the will of the gods. However, our meeting you is also the will of the gods, so I'll pray for the blessings of Einhasad to rest upon you. Next time, seek someone who can teach someone on your own path.
