<html><body>Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
To be qualified to be a Shillien Oracle, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Shillien Oracle.<br>
However, you cannot change profession here. This is because only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond the plateau are qualified to change profession.<br>For these reasons, you should leave this forest and go to the Human Kingdom of Aden. There is a guild secretly built by Dark Elves in the town of Gludio, which is the closest southern land from here. You should visit Grand Masters, who are the highest ranking drillmasters of our guilds, and satisfy their demands to be permitted to change profession.<br>
Also, there are two villages you can go to from the Dark Forest. One is the village of Gludin. Even though it is very far from here, you can get there by following the road towards the School of Dark Arts. The other way is to go through the Neutral Zone and to the town of Gludio, which is a little closer. However, there are many Elves in the Neutral Zone, so there could be conflicts.<br>
