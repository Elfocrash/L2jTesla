To become a Shillien Oracle, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. Also, a token that proves you have passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle is required.<br>
It seems that you admirably passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you have a token. Come back when you have raised your level.
