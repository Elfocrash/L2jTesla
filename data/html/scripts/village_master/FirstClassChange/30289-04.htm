To become an Elven Wizard, you must bring back the <font color="LEVEL">eternity diamond</font> as proof of your worthiness. This means you have earned the right to become an Elven Wizard. If you go to the Elven village and meet the Elf <font color="LEVEL">Rosella</font>, she will give you the test. You must pass her test to become an Elven Wizard. Since Rosella is in the village, it won't be hard to find her.<br>
