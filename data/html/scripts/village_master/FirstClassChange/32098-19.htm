Anyone wishing to become an Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
I regret to say, my child, that you have not yet met the requirements. You must bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font> and pass the test given by <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel in Gludio</font>.
