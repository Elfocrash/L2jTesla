To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Human Knight, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Human Knight. You can only be accepted as a true Human Knight when you pass the test. If you want to know more about the test, visit <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font> in <font color="LEVEL">the village of Gludin</font>. He is near the fighters guild of Gludin. You can change profession to Human Knight if you pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">sword of ritual</font>.
