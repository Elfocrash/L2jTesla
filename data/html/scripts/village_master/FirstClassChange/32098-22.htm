<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Congratulations -- you have been reborn as Eva's priest! As the goddess' servant, your road ahead may be filled with danger. But you will walk that path with Einhasad's blessing and Eva's protection. Congratulations again on your transfer!<br>
This is a small gift we have prepared to help you travel the path ahead of you. Take it and go to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
