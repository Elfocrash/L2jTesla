Congratulations! Now you are a noble Elven Knight. The path of the Elven Knight may still feel strange but do not worry -- learn step by step from the Masters around you.<br>
In the future, I hope you will be a famed Elven Knight who glorifies Eva's name. Keep your dignity and your faith as an Elf to the end. Congratulations again on becoming an Elven Knight!
