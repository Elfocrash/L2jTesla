<html><body>Grand Master Bitz:<br>
To become a Rogue, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Rogue. But as I told you, you cannot become a Rogue here. You must first go out into the world and improve your skills.<br>
Therefore, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> to become a Rogue. There is a ship bound for the village of Gludin departing from the port southwest of the village. Sail to <font color="LEVEL">the village of Gludin</font> and find <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Ramos</font>. He will help you. You will be able to change profession after you pass the Test of the Rogue which he will give you.<br>
