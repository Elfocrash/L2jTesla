<html><body>Head Blacksmith Tapoy:<br>
I am Head Blacksmith Tapoy of the Black Anvil Guild. The Black Anvil Guild is a proud guild that produces Dwarven Fighters and Artisans. You didn't come because you thought you could learn something from me, did you? Not just anyone can learn the skills that have been handed down in our race for 2,000 years. Now that you know, go back to waving your sword around and killing poor monsters.
