To become an Raider, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Raider, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Raider. To take the Test of the Raider, go to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. If you pass the test and come back, I will change your profession. To get to the Orc village, first go to Gludio, then use a Gatekeeper.
