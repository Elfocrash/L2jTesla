<font color="LEVEL">Wizards</font> do much more than merely study the primal energy of the earth. They've actually found practical and deadly uses for this awesome force! Their penchant for destruction leaves them little time for White and Support Magics. They prefer instead the Elemental, Dark and Summoning Magics. Their control of Servitors makes them formidable opponents on the battlefield.<br>
Some Wizards train at the Ivory Tower in Oren to become <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerers, Warlocks or Necromancers</font>. This path is by no means an easy one, as evidenced by the dearth of high-level Wizards coming out of the Ivory Tower!<br>
All who wish to become Wizards must bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>.<br>
