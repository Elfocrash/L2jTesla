<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Human Knight, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Human Knight. You can only be accepted as a true knight when you pass the test. If you want to know more about the test, visit <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper</font>, who is a senior Knight of the order. He will be somewhere around this guild. You can easily find him outside. You can change profession to Knight if you pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">sword of ritual</font>.
