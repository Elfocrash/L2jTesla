To become a Dark Wizard, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You must also have a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Dark Wizard.<br>
It seems that you admirably passed the Test of the Dark Wizard, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you have a token. Come back when you have raised your level.
