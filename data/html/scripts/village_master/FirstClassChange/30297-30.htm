Congratulations! At last you are a Shillien Oracle of the proud Dark Elves. The path of a Shillien Oracle might be strange for you now, but there is nothing to worry about -- everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
Strive to be a Shillien Oracle of great dignity, who increases the pride of Dark Elves everywhere. I hope you will make the names of Shilen and Gran Kain feared throughout the sunlit world. Congratulations again on becoming a Shillien Oracle, our proud Celebrant!
