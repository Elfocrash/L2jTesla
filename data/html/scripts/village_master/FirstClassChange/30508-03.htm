Basically, to earn the qualifications to become an Raider, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Raider.<br>
To take the Test of the Raider, go to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. If you pass the test and come back, I will change your profession. To get to the Orc village, first go to Gludio, then use a Gatekeeper.<br>
