<html><body>Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
I am chosen by Gran Kain, the father of shadow, and Shilen, the mother of the abyss. On behalf of the Patriarch, who was sealed by those who were servants to the light, I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. I am Tetrarch Thifiell, who released his brothers from the underground place of exile and recaptured the shadow forest from Elves. I do not wish to speak with other races. Please leave here.
