<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Anyone of level 20 or above who wishes to transfer classes must pass the test and bring the proof associated with their chosen occupation.<br>
Your level is sufficient, but you still haven't passed the test to become a Wizard. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Parina</font> and collect proof of all four elements to obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Bead of Season</font>. Then I shall happily promote you to Wizard.
