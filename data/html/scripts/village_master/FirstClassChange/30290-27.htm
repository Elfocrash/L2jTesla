To become a Shillien Oracle, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. Also, a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle is required.<br>
However, it seems your level is not high enough, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. First, try to raise your level to 20 or higher. To take the test, you should visit <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Sidra</font> of the Dark Elven Guild in the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. You can change profession to Shillien Oracle only if you pass her test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">orb of abyss</font> as a token. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east.
