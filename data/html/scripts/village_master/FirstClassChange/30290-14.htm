The <font color="LEVEL">orb of abyss</font> is given only to those who have passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the Test of the Shillien Oracle, you should find <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Sidra</font> in the Dark Elven Guild of the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. As you know, you can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is much easier.<br>
