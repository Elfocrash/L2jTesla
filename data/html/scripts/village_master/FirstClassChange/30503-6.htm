Haven't I explained this to you? You must be at least level 20 to become a Scavenger.<br>
It seems that you have admirably passed the Test of the Scavenger, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you have passed the test. Go out and kill some monsters to increase your level before coming back.
