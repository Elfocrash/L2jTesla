All who wish to become Elven Wizards must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
I'm sorry, my child, but you don't meet the qualifications. You should speak with <font color="LEVEL">Rosella in Elven Village</font>. Pass her test and I'll transfer you to the Elven Wizard class.
