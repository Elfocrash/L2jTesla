To become a Shillien Oracle, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. Also, a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle is required.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the test, you should find <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Sidra</font> in the Dark Elven Guild of the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. You can change profession to Shillien Oracle only if you pass her test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">orb of abyss</font> as a token. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east.
