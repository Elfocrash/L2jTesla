<html><body>Head Blacksmith Bronk:<br>
I am Head Blacksmith Bronk of the Black Anvil Guild. The Black Anvil Guild is a proud guild that trains Dwarven Fighters and Artisans. You didn't come because you thought I could teach you, did you? Not just anyone can learn the skills that have been handed down in our race for 2,000 years. Now that you know, you can go back to waving your sword around and hunting poor monsters.
