To become an Elven Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Elven Knight, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Elven Knight. You can become an Elven Knight only by passing the test. To take the test, go to <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius</font> of our guild. You must pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight brooch</font> as proof.
