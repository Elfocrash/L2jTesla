<html><body>High Priestess Levian:<br>
You have already far surpassed the abilities of most people. You cannot now return to such a lowly profession.<br>
Judging from your strength, I believe that your faith sustains you on your path. Keep your faith to the end, and move forward. May the will of Einhasad guide you to the path of righteousness.
