<html><body>Head Blacksmith Opix:<br>
To become an Artisan, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession.<br>
It seems that you have admirably passed the Test of the Artisan, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not appropriate, even if you have passed the test. Come back when you raise your level.
