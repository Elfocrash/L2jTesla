<html><body>Grand Master Tronix:<br>
Congratulations! Now you are a proud Palus Knight of the Dark Elves. The way of the Palus Knight may still feel strange, but do not worry -- everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
In the future, may you be a proud Dark Elf of great dignity, who glorifies the name of Shilen and destroys the arrogant Elves in glorious battle. Congratulations again on becoming a Palus Knight!
