<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
To become an Elven Knight, you must prove your ability. That has always been the job of <font color="LEVEL">Master Sorius, who lives in the town of Gludio</font>. He has taught Elven Knights for a long time, and he give you the test appropriate for you. You should bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Knight brooch</font> which he will give you when you pass his test. You can reach the town of Gludio by following the road east from this village. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is faster. In Gludio, go to the Warrior Guild and look for Master Sorius.<br>
