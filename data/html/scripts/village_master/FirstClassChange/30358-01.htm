A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. Unfortunately, you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. Dark Fighters like yourself can change profession to become a <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knight</font> or an <font color="LEVEL">Assassin</font>. Which profession do you want to learn about?<br>
