To obtain the qualifications to become an Shaman, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Shaman.<br>
To take the Test of the Shaman, go to <font color="LEVEL">Tataru Zu Hestui of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.<br>
