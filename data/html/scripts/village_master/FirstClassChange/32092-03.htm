To qualify to become an Scavenger, your level must be at least be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Scavenger.<br>
However, even if you earn these qualifications, I cannot change your profession. This is because only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond the Spine Mountains are qualified to change profession. A Dwarf must have a full understanding of the outside world's economy.<br>
To take the Test of the Scavenger, go to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Yasheni</font>. He will give you detailed instructions. If you pass the test and earn your qualifications, go to the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Rikadio</font> in the blacksmith's there. If you have met the qualifications, he will change your profession to Scavenger.<br>
