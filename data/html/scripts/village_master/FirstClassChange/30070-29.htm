<html><body>High Priest Sylvain:<br>
You need the appropriate level and token to become a Cleric. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Cleric, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Cleric.<br>
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the Test of the Cleric. You will be acknowledged as a true Cleric only when you have passed the test. If you wish to take the test, visit <font color="LEVEL">Priest Zigaunt in the village of Gludin</font>. You must pass his test and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">mark of faith</font> to change profession to Cleric. As I'm sure you know, just follow the road west to reach the village of Gludin.
