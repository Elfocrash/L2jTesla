To be qualified to become a Dark Wizard, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Dark Wizard. You must meet <font color="LEVEL">Shamaness Varika</font> to take the Test of the Dark Wizard. She is staying at the altar, southwest of the village. You must pass the test she gives you and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">jewel of darkness</font> as proof.<br>
However, you cannot change profession here. This is because only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond are qualified to change profession.<br>
For these reasons, you should leave this forest and go to the Human kingdom of Aden. There is a guild secretly built by Dark Elves in the town of Gludio, which is the closest southern land from here. The Grand Masters there will change your profession.<br>
