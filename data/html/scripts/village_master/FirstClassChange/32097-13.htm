Anyone wishing to become an Orc Monk must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Orc Monk test.<br>
You've done neither! Raise your level, take the Orc Monk test, and then bring me the proof. To take the test, go see <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu in the Orc Village</font>. He was once a great Orc Monk, and now teaches young Orcs the ways of battle. Pass his test and I'll make you an Orc Monk.
