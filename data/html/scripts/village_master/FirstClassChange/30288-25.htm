Congratulations! Now you are an honored Elven Scout. The path of the Elven Scout may still feel strange, but do not worry -- learn step by step from the Masters around you.<br>
In the future, I hope you will be a brave Elven Scout who glorifies Eva's name. Keep your dignity and your faith as an Elf to the end. Congratulations again on becoming an Elven Scout!
