<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
Basically, to be qualified for a Monk, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Monk.<br>
It seems that you have passed the Test of the Monk, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even though you have a token. Come back when you have increased your level.
