Congratulations! At last you are a Dark Wizard of the proud Dark Elves. The path of the Dark Wizard might be strange for you now, but do not worry too much -- everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
May you be a Dark Wizard of great dignity, who makes the names of Shilen and Gran Kain feared throughout the sunlit world. Congratulations again on becoming a Dark Wizard of mighty magical power!
