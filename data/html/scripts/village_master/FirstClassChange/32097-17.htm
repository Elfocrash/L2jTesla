Anyone wishing to become an Orc Shaman must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test.<br>
You've done neither! Raise your level, take the Orc Shaman test, and then bring me the proof. To take the test, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Tataru Zu Hestui in the Orc Village</font>. Pass his test and I'll make you an Orc Monk.
