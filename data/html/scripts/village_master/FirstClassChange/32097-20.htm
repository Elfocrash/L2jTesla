<html><body>High Prefect Finker:<br>
Oroca Tejakar! Congratulations! You are now an honorable Orc Shaman. I pray that you will use your power to help restore the glory of the Orc race.<br>
If you wish to learn new magic, ask <font color="LEVEL">Seer Moira</font> nearby. He will guide you.<br>
And here is a small gift to help you in your journey! Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you can exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon!
