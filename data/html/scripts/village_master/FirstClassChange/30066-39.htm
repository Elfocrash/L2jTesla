<html><body>Grand Master Pabris:<br>
You have already changed profession for the last time.
Someone as accomplished as yourself must already have met many people and seen many things. Consider, then, what kind of person you want to be remembered as. A merciless, absolute power? A guardian angel of justice? An incarnation of evil? Wherever you go, do not forget that a sound faith is the only thing that will lead you in the right path.
