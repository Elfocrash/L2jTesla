<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
You have already selected your profession, and your strength is plain to see. For someone like you, there is no further advice that I can give. I just hope that you use your power in the service of Einhasad, mother of all good, and for the weak and poor. May the light of Einhasad always be with you.
