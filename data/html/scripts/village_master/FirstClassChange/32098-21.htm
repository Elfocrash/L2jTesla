<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Anyone wishing to become an Oracle must have achieved at least level 20 and proven themselves by passing a test.<br>
Your level is sufficient, but you must still pass the test. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Manuel</font> in the temple in the northern part of Gludio. Pass his test and he'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Leaf of Oracle</font> in return.
