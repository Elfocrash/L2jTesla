To become an Assassin, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Assassin.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Assassin. To become an Assassin, find <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> and pass the test that he gives you, bringing back the <font color="LEVEL">iron heart</font> as proof. He is always near the Dark Elven Guild in the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>, so you will easily find him nearby once you get there.
