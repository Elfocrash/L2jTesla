To become a Warrior, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You need the <font color="LEVEL">medallion of the Warrior</font> to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Warrior. You will only be accepted as a true Warrior after you pass the test. Go ask <font color="LEVEL">Master Aymus</font> of our guild about the Test of the Warrior.
