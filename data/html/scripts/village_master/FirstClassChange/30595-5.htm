Look here, didn't I tell you before? To meet the qualifications to become an Artisan, your level must be at least be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Artisan. You haven't done either one.<br>
Go and take the Test of the Artisan. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Silvery in the Dwarven village</font> about it. She is the judge of the first test. If you ask, she'll tell you everything you need to know. After you have passed the test and raised your level, come to me. I will change your profession to Artisan. You still have a long way to go.
