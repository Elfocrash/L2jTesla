It's rather simple, really. Once one reaches a certain level of ability and experience, that person transfers to the next class level. For example, you, as an Elven Mystic, may become an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizard</font> or an <font color="LEVEL">Elven Oracle</font>. If you'd like, I can explain either of these occupations to you.<br>
