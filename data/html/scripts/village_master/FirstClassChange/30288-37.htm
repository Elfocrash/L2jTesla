Congratulations! Now you are a subtle Rogue! The path of the Rogue may still feel strange, but do not worry -- learn step by step from the Masters around you.<br>
From now on, I hope you will be dashing Rogue whose deeds are sung in the lands of Aden. Remember to hold onto your own values and faith. Congratulations again on becoming a Rogue!
