<html><body>High Prefect Finker:<br>
Anyone wishing to become an Orc Raider must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Orc Raider test.<br>
You've done neither! Get to level 20 and then go and find <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia in the Orc Village</font>. He was once a great Orc Warrior, and now he teaches young Orcs the ways of war. Pass his test and bring me the proof, andI'll make you an Orc Raider!
