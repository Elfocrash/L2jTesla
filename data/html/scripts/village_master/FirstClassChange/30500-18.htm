<html><body>High Prefect Osborn:<br>
To obtain the qualifications to become an Orc Shaman, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Orc Shaman.<br>
It seems that you have passed the Test of the Orc Shaman, but your level is not sufficient. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even though you have a token. Raise your level and come back.
