To qualify to become an Artisan, your level must be at least be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Artisan.<br>
However, even if you earn these qualifications, I cannot change your profession. This is because only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond the Spine Mountains are qualified to change profession. A Dwarf must have a full understanding of the outside world's economy.<br>
To take the Test of the Artisan, go to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Silvera</font>. She will give you detailed instructions. If you pass the test and earn your qualifications, go to the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Tapoy</font> in the blacksmith's there. If you have met the qualifications, he will change your profession to Artisan.<br>
