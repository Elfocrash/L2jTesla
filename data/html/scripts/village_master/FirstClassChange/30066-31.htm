To become a Human Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. To become a Knight, you need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Human Knight, as well.<br>
It seems that you have admirably passed the Test of the Human Knight, but your level is not high enough. Level 20 or higher is required to change profession. I cannot allow you to change profession if your level is not sufficient, even if you have a token. Come back when you have raised your level.
