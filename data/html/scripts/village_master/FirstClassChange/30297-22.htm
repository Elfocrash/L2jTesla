Congratulations! You are an Assassin of the proud Dark Elves at last. The way of the Assassin may still feel strange, but do not worry -- everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.<br>
May you be an Assassin of renown, worthy to walk in the way of Shilen. Endeavor always to be the best Assassin and Dark Elf, a true master of the night. Congratulations again on becoming an Assassin!
