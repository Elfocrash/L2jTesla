To become an Assassin, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Assassin.<br>
I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Assassin. To become an Assassin, find <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font> and pass the test that he gives you and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">steel heart</font> as proof. He is always near our guild, so you will find him easily.
