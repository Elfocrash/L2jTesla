<html><body>Grand Magister Celes:<br>
Congratulations! You have advanced one level as a child of the god. Advancing in life means that you are preparing for both joy and the accompanying sorrow. But you will walk that path with Einhasad's blessing and under Eva's protection. Congratulations again on your transfer!<br>
This is a small gift that we have prepared to help you travel the path ahead. Take it and go to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
