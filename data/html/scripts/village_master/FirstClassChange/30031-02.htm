The <font color="LEVEL">Human Wizard</font> is an advanced Mystic who can practice elemental magic, black magic and summoning magic. Also, the Human Wizard can strike down enemies directly with the most powerful magic. However, the Human Wizard must turn away from the arts of white magic and summoning magic in order to concentrate on attack magic. Nevertheless, it's quite a fascinating profession, particularly in its ability to summon servitors.<br>
