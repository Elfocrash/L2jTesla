<html><body>Ivan:<br>
Oh, you're an adventurer, aren't you? Phew... I'm Ivan. I'm a fisherman like my father! But to tell you the truth, I hate the smell of fish! So I left home... I've been wandering around this dangerous place, and now I'm thinking that maybe my father was right after all! I wish I could go back home... Maybe one day you'll be able to help me.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 26 and above.)
