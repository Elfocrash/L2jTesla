I give you my deepest gratitude. Go immediately to the <font color="LEVEL">Underground Fortress</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">ten undead Bone Fragments and three Elf Skulls</font>. The skulls must be whole and intact, with no flaws. According to Magister Esrandell, flawless and unscarred Elf Skulls may only be obtained from the monsters called the <font color="LEVEL">dark terrors</font>. Dark terror, mist terror and shade horror ... they are all related.<br>
I wish to present my fellow soldiers, who have suffered long enough, with eternal peace as soon as possible. Please. Hurry.</body></html>
