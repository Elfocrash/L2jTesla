Did you know? The most intense battle against the evil Dark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full of monsters. I was there when the last battle took place and still remember it vividly. I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety, and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from the battle.<br>
The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as a powerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead. I should have chosen death like my fellow soldiers ... I am so ashamed that I am still alive ... I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens ...<br>
I wish to break the curse so that my friends may rest in peace in the afterlife. I will still not be forgiven for my sins against them, but I don't think I could ever live without doing something. Along with Sorcerer Esrandell, my long time friend, we are researching methods to counter the curse of the Underground Fortress, but we have yet to find an answer. When we find a method in the future, I would like to ask your help.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by any character, except Dark Elf, of level 12 and above.)
