Thank you. Now all that is left is to figure out the origin of the black magic energy from the fortress. My old friend Magister Esrandell will also thank you, I'm sure. Please pray that we may send the souls of my fallen fellows into the arms of Eva.<br>
Please, take this. This is in gratitude for your work to bring eternal peace to our brothers who died for the future of our race. May honor and the spirits of the forest guide you on your path.</body></html>
