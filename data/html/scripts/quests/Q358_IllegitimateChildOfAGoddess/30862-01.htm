<html><body>Grand Master Oltlin:<br>
Have you seen the sights of the city? The wonderful castles built by humans, in spite of countless errors and obstacles. Do you have any idea what is beneath them? Often, long shadows are cast under the glow of glory.<br>
You always find the darkest shadows under strong light. Does this make sense to you? I thought not. It seems you will need more training. Why don't you explore the world some more and come back later.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 63 and above.)
