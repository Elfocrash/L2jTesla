Thank you for your efforts. I know it was not easy... Needless to say, please don't tell other people that you have done this for me. Above all my children must never learn of it...<br>
In exchange for your efforts, I will give you this Secret Book in which ancient secret creation methods are recorded. I hope it will be helpful to you.<br>
Too many people think they can cover the sky with the palm of their hand. There is such a thing as too much truth... My work will likely never end... If you are ever interested in helping me again, come back to see me.
