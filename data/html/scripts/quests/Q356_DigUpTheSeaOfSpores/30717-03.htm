Frankly, I'm not sure. Up to now our research has been focused on sustaining and strengthening the magic force field tower.<br>
However, it has become clear that we need a more permanent solution. For this we must return to the Sea of Spores itself.<br>
We must shift our strategy to researching each individual spore, one by one.<br>
We must study the colonies they build, how they spawn and the complex relationships between the plants and animals of the sea.<br>
