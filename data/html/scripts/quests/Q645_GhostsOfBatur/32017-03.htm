We can help the Spiteful Souls in the <font color="LEVEL">Crypts of Disgrace</font> to become "saved" before they travel elsewhere. When you defeat the Spiteful Souls, you will see some <font color="LEVEL">Cursed Grave Accessories</font> which they used to manifest their physical power. Please these accessories them and bring them to me.<br>
By my current estimate, I need about <font color="LEVEL">180</font> of them. If you get me that many, I think I can do the rest.<br>
