The skull of the Blood Fiend Kirunak... if only this would wash away the sins of the past...<br>
Thank you. I'll compensate you as promised. And... I must make a confession. It was not the Dark Elven Mystics, but I that called forth Kirunak from hell during the last siege of the fortress. Originally I was an Elemental Summoner commanding the elements of nature, but I was swept up by the madness of battle and used forbidden sorcery to summon the devils. But I could not control the violence of the Drevanuls. They started to slay not only the Dark Elves, but also those of my race. I was seized with fear, and fled without ever looking back.<br>
You do not need to speak, I know. The sin of murdering hundreds of my kin will never be washed clean ... but with your help I sent the devils that I summoned back to the place they came from, and that is a great consolation to me. What can I say? I cannot expect to avoid your blame. But at least know this, that I have lived for more than three hundred years in painful regret.
