Among the many battles with the Dark Elves, the fiercest battle took place in the Underground Fortress. The last battle between the two races happened there. The blood of the injured from both sides ran red on the floor of the fortress, and crows covered the skies. Suddenly, the gates of hell opened and the <font color="LEVEL">Drevanuls</font>, devils from hell, spilled forth. The Dark Elven magicians, driven into a corner, had called upon these bloodthirsty devils.<br>
Hundreds of Elves and Dark Elves alike were cruelly slain in the Underground Fortress in a bloody, evil feast of insanity. Luckily I survived, but I still suffer from nightmares. One day, I will avenge the death of my brothers who died at the hands of the devils.<br>
