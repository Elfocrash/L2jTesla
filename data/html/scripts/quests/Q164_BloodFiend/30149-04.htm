The <font color="LEVEL">Drevanul</font> devils that came through the gates of hell during the last battle still live in the ruins of the Underground Fortress. Their leader is the Drevanul <font color="LEVEL">Kirunak</font>, also called the 'Blood Fiend'. Slay Kirunak and bring back his <font color="LEVEL">skull</font> as proof of his death. Our revenge will then be complete.<br>
May the brilliance of Einhasad's will protect you. Do not hesitate to raise high the sword of revenge!
