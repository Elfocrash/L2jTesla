A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight!<br>
And a long line of ancient kings! King of Unification Raul, Old King van Halter, King of Insolence Baium, Founding Emperor Shunaiman and the Queen of Elves Beora.... Those were the days! An Orc was the advance guard and an Elf was the page. And there is the King of the Giants! He was the best king, but his insolence poisoned his relationship with the goddess...<br>
A king of evil creeping in darkness with the power of a ruler!<br>
A kingdom rises or falls depending on the heart of its King! Only a very few are worthy to be called King! What does it mean to be King?<br>
Successor of Flame Akkan left to meet a tyrant with that question on his mind. He wants to know the difference between a king and a tyrant!</body></html>
