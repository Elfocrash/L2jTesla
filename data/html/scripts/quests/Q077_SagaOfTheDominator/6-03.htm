<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br>
You see Kadia, the Hestui who threw herself into the nest of Antharas in order to find herself, and Akkan, the Successor of Flame, who missed her so badly that he decided to become a king and went on a pilgrimage.<br>
And Atrus, in search of the ancient conqueror!<br>
Kadia found herself and Akkan found he wasn't really cut out to be a king. But Atrus... Well, she gave into the temptations of power!<br>
Now she stands before the Tablet of Vision holding the Resonance Amulet! You can find her near the Ketra Orc Outpost!</body></html>
