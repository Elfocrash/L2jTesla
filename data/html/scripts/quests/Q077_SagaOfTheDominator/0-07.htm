According to historical documents, whoever completes the Pilgrimage of the King obtains the right to rule! Flame Successor Akkan has recommended that you become one of the successors of the sacred flame! Of course, this doesn't mean that you could be king, but at least now you stand a better chance of becoming a chief!<br>
Judging by the way the Dudamara told me you led the king's pilgrim, you definitely have what it takes to lead a tribe!<br>
You must remember to always behave accordingly! Your world is what you make it!</body></html>
