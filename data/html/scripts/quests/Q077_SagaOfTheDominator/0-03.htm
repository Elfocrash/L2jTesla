 Flame Lord Kakai has truly amazing power! Without him we would never survive the endless winter! But alas, he has no successor. If he dies now, who will save us?<br>
 Overlords are quite rare in these parts. Among them, those worthy of becoming king are even fewer! I've lost touch with Cardia of the Hestui tribe and Akkan of the Neruga tribe... Even Atlus of the Gandi tribe has disappeared without a trace!<br>
 You're my only hope! All I could find out from the Dudamara was where Flame Successor Akkan may be headed! Please go after him, my Overlord! I've heard that a Ketra Orc Messenger of the Betrayer Lesser Orcs has met with him. You must find Akkan!</body></html>
