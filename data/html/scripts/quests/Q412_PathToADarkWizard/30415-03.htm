Those wretched murderers threw the corpses of my family in the <font color="LEVEL">marsh</font>, but I can't bear to go there to search. If I could devour those murderers like a wild beast, it still wouldn't satisfy my hunger for revenge! Please find the bodies of my parents and younger sister. I beg you. The Marsh Zombies have probably torn up the corpses. <font color="LEVEL">Kill the Marsh Zombies and bring back the three remains, please.</font><br>
This key was given to me by my parents as a gift. It is supposed to bring good luck. Carry this with you.
