The Dark Forest is peaceful and orderly, but Gludio is not like that. The wounds of war still run red in that place. A Sorcerer in the past went mad, and did things that should not have been done.<br>
He made live Humans the subjects of his experiments. After the experiments, they were no longer Humans. The scientist turned them into skeletons, you see. <font color="LEVEL">Kill the skeleton scouts in the Ruins of Agony in Gludio and find the Heart of Lunacy, left by that Sorcerer whose lunacy created the evil.</font><br>
Here is a perfume made from crushed herbs, it will defend your mind from the curse of that madness.
