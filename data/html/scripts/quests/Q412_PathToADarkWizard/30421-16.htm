So you have finally collected the Seeds of Anger, Despair, Horror and Lunacy. Now do you know the source of our power? There is no need to be afraid. All you have to do is control these by your will.<br>
Emotion is important when dealing with nature's elementals. Don't forget that emotion is the source of power. Since you have gathered all the seeds needed to become a Dark Wizard, I will give you a token. Take this token to the Grand Master of the Dark Elven Guild and you can become a Dark Wizard.<br>
The nearest village where Dark Elves reside is the village of Gludin. Go and seek <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Xenos</font> there. He will change your profession to a Dark Wizard. Well then my friend, may the divine protection of Shilen be with you.
