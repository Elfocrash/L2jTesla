You have found the Heart of Lunacy. This must be handled very carefully. If you are careless, it will burst. This heart is an important ingredient in the making of medicine. This much will make a lot of medicine.<br>
If you dry one of these hearts, it will become a Seed of Lunacy. Since you found all the hearts, I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Lunacy</font> as a reward. If you carry this with you, you will not be tormented by evil creatures.
