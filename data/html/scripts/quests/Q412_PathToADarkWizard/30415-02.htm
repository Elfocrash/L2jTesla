My family ... We built a house near the waterfall and lived happily, tending our fields. Then suddenly, one day, an Elven militia corps showed up and threatened us, but we didn't pay much attention because we though it was just the normal harassment. But the day I went up to repair the roof for the rainy season, they swarmed into the house and killed my entire family ...<br>
I was a powerless coward, and I held my breath on the roof and just watched. As my family was killed one by one in front of my eyes, I pressed myself close to the roof so that I would not be seen, and did nothing to save them until they were all dead ...<br>
What sins did I commit for my family to be murdered! I will take revenge on those Elves by doing exactly what they did! I will make them understand how it feels to be able to do nothing while your loved ones die in front of your eyes! Ahh ... My family ...<br>
Could you do me a favor? It's nothing difficult...<br>
