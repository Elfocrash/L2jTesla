I didn't think it would be easy to find all the remains of my family ... I know the marsh is quite large ...<br>
They say that the Marsh Zombies love dead bodies, so I'm sure they have scattered the corpses of my family. I do not care how long it takes. Please find their remains. Please, I beg you.
