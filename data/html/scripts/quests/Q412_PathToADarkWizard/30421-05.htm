Dark Wizards can control the power of nature and perform powerful magic. But you should be aware of the origin of power that enables magic.<br>
Long ago, our mother Shilen was insulted by Einhasad and betrayed by the Elves when they began to serve Eva. Since then, the origin of our power is darkness, like our mother Shilen. Dark power consists of four factors -- <font color="LEVEL">anger, despair, horror and lunacy.</font> You can qualify to become a Dark Wizard only if you collect the four seeds that symbolize these things.<br>
