Thank you very much. Thanks to you, I can safely complete my training. Soon, I will earn the qualifications to become a sentry. When I do, my friends won't laugh at me anymore.<br>
I give you this in thanks for helping me. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it is definitely very precious. It looks like a <font color="LEVEL">seed</font> or something... It looks quite marvelous, I've never seen anything like it before. I found it in the nearby woods a few days ago.
