Ah, you are a true adventurer! Go and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Pachycephalosaurus and wild striders</font> and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">bones of dinosaurs from the plains</font>. I will purchase them from you on Karakawei's behalf.<br>
Just as a favor to you, I heard from a friend of mine who trades with the island natives that the native shaman is also in the market for dinosaur bones. While you're at it, you may want to try to contact him as well.<br>
