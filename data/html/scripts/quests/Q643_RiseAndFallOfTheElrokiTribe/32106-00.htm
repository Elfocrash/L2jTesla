Ah, an adventurer! Are you looking for a job? Since the discovery of this Primeval Isle, Aden port has added a wharf for those interested in seeing the strange new island for themselves.<br>
In fact, we're getting flooded with adventurers and wizards eager to uncover the island's mysteries or test their mettle against the terrible creatures there.<br>
We handle tickets here for the ship bound for the island as well as offering accommodations for those who wish to trade with the natives.<br>
Now we have expanded our service to connect adventurers with those in need of their services.<br>
I have just one request, but hmmm...<br>
I don't think that you're suited for this particular task.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 75 and above.)
