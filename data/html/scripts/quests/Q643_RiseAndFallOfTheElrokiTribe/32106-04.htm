The shaman lives on the island's southern Primeval Plains. He doesn't like to have contact with outsiders, though, so you'll need someone he trusts to vouch for you before he'll likely talk to you. There is a native warrior, <font color="LEVEL">Orahochin</font>, who lives at the foot of the mountain between the southern shore of Primeval Plains and the Lost Nest. I've heard that he is more accepting of outsiders.
