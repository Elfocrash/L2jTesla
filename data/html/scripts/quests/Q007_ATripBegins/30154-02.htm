<html><body>Hierarch:<br>
The outside world is a terribly chaotic place, nothing like our beautiful Elven Forest. Don't get me wrong, we have our share of problems, but nothing approaching the ravages that plague the world of the Humans.<br>
But I've always said, "All young Elves should see <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Giran</font> at least once!" It's a Human village and an important travel hub. It's also a microcosm of the outside world and would be the perfect place for you to start your journey.<br>
When you're ready to go, speak with <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Mirabel</font>. I'll ask her to help you.
