Excellent! I gave you a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Traveler's Mark.</font><br>
Now remember, it can only be used once, and I gave you my last one! The Traveler's Mark was provided by Hierarch Asterios. When you're ready to return, visit Trader Galladucci at his boutique. Show him the mark and he'll help you.<br>
You must be careful! Giran is a very crowded and chaotic place and there are dangerous beasts there!<br>
May the divine blessings of Eva be upon you!
