<html><body>Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
Very few gatekeepers truly understand this world. I've visited countless cities and villages, but certainly can't say that I understand everyone who lives in them.<br>
It's hard to find a place as beautiful and peaceful as our Elven Forest, but the outside world also has much to offer. In particular, an unspeakably crowded place like Giran is full of opportunities.<br>
As a traveler, you must know what I'm talking about.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven character of level 3 and above.)
