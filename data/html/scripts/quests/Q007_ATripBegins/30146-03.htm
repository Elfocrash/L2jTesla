<HTML><BODY>Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>
You are imprudent! Though you can travel to the outside world via this space-time door, it should only be used at my discretion. You don't even know where you should go!<br>
Experience is the best teacher, but it will not be easy for you to adjust to the outer world, removed from the comforting shade of the World Tree and the benefits of Eva's protection.<br>
If you really wish to travel to the outside world, ask for advice from a more experienced traveler: <font color="LEVEL">Trader Ariel</font>, for example. He is widely-traveled adventurer who could advise you on how to prepare and what to expect.<br>
Go talk with him.
