I travel to <font color="LEVEL">Oren's Ivory Tower</font> once or twice a year. What kind of place is the Ivory Tower of Oren, you ask? It is the headquarters of Mystics, as well as an educational institute, and a place where Mystics gather. You can get useful magic potions and materials from the Traders or Mystics of the Ivory Tower.<br>
But during my recent visit, some of them asked me to bring them magic materials that can only be found in our Dark Forest. They said that they would pay handsomely for the items they need. So I've recently started to sell goods such as the wings of an imp or an arachne's web there. I'm looking to see if I can gather some more precious items for sale. I will ask for your help when the time comes. I'm going to need more hands if I want to gather large amounts of any item.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 8 and above.)
