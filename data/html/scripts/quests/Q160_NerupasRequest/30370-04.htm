Go to <font color="LEVEL">Unoren</font>, who works in the weapons and armor store, and give him this silvery Spider Silk. And in return, I have asked him to get the <font color="LEVEL">Nightshade Leaf</font> for me. Unoren said that the Nightshade Leaf is hard to find and offered "adena" instead. But I refused.<br>
A young Elf such as yourself may not know this, but we children of the forest have always lived a life where we obtain what we need from nature, trading what we have obtained for other objects, and giving back to nature as much as we have received. But some time ago the Elves learned a strange habit from the Dwarves. The strange practice of giving metal or slips of paper instead of bartering. But I can't understand "money" or "adena" at all.<br>
Eventually, Unoren agreed to find the Nightshade Leaf for me. Get it from him and bring it back to me.
