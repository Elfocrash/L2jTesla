If not for the order given by the Elven elders, I would not just stand by and watch a foreigner such as yourself set foot into our sacred woods! The guardians of the forest are watching your every move, so beware! Dare to disobey just one law of the forest and I will kill you without hesitation!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven character.)
