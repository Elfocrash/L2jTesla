<html><body>Trader Unoren:<br>
Ah, the Spider Silk that I asked Nerupa to obtain for me. Thank you. This Silvery Spidersilk that the silver spiders spin...very strong and flexible, yet light, which makes it a good material for strongbows.<br>
Oh, did Nerupa tell you to get something from me? Hah, Nerupa still insists on trading the old-fashioned way -- bartering. She was absolutely livid when I told her that I'd pay money for the spidersilks. So, she asked me to find the <font color="LEVEL">Nighshade Leaf</font> for her instead. It's very hard to get, but thankfully Creamees of the magic shop recently managed to obtain a few nighshade leaves, and I have ordered one from him.<br>
Here, take this receipt and go to <font color="LEVEL">Creamees,</font> he'll give you the Nighshade Leaf, which you'll give to Nerupa.
