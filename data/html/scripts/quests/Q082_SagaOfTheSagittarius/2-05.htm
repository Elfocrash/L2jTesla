 Sagittarius's bow was stolen?<br>
 A few days ago someone was asking about The Bow.<br>
What? You want me to tell you about him for free?<br>
 You want me to starve?<br>
 Hahaha...<br>
 Well I don't want to get any this time.<br>
Since you're in the union, it won't cost you money.<br>
Hmm<br>
...<br>
I know. I'm embarrassed to admit it.<br>
However, I have a crush on Lilly, my partner Mist's granddaughter! I'll tell you more if you find out what Lilly likes and bring it to me!<br>
 I'll give you a hint: Mist knows everything about Lilly!<br>
Don't tell him what I said! You shoud find the way by yourself! You'll find them in the hot springs area!</body></html>
