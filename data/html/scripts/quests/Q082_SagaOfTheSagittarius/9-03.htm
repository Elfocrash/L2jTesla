<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter your body.<br>
You begin to see visions. You see a landscape, I see a male Human. I see a monument that looks like the Tablet of Vision.<br>
It looks like it is located somewhere in the southwest of the Forest of the Dead.<br>
The force out of the Tablet grows less and less.</body></html>
