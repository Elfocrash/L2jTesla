Thank you so much!<br>
You'll be well-rewarded if you solve this problem.<br>
It's only fair, right? Ha!<br>
Whoever stole my bow was a very cunning thief. He took it right from under my nose!<br>
I'll wager that Information Broker Grimst knows about this robbery. You should ask him for the details.<br>
Oh, by the way, this book was found at the scene of the crime.<br>
You should get going!</body></html>
