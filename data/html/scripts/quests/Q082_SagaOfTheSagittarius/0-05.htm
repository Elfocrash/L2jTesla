<html><body>Hunter Guild President Bernard:<br>
Sagittarius's bow, the symbol of our guild, was stolen.<br>
During the day, it's on display, but at night, I keep it close at hand.<br>
I was delayed putting it in the safe for just a minute while counting my new coins.<br>
This must be a conspiracy against me.<br>
Your reputation is growing, I would appreciate your help.<br>
