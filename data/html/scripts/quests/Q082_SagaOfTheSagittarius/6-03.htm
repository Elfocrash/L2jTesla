<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter your body.<br>
You begin to see visions. You see a landscape, I can see the Tablet that has the same shape as this Tablet.<br>
It seems to be located in the southeast part of the Wall of Argos.<br>
You feel the Tablet of Vision weakening.</body></html>
