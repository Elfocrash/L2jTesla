Dear brother of the Black Lion, shouldn't you be on the battlefield?<br>
Ah, that box looks familiar... It's a traders union Cargo Box. Since we have no agreement regarding the return of a Cargo Box, we aren't obliged to return the cargo to the traders. But if we return it perhaps they will give us a reward!<br>
If you don't want to deal with traders, you can go see Redfoot. He is an expert in disposing of stolen property.<br>
