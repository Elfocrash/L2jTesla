<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
You must kill the <font color="LEVEL">delu lizardmen, including their scouts and warriors</font>. Take care, for although they are similar to the felim and langk lizardmen, they are much more dangerous.<br>
As proof of their death you must bring me their <font color="LEVEL">teeth</font>. The more of their teeth you bring, the greater shall be your reward. Since you served under Captain Leopold, you already know the rules of proofs and rewards, am I right?<br>
Time is of the essence, you must go and destroy them!
