Do you care to watch the master at work? First, I will attach the legs to the base... Then the torso above that... Now we match the joints of the arms and head properly... Voila! It's finished! The joints are still visible, but overall, it looks wonderful, don't you think? Hmm... Is this a statue of the goddess of Shilen? The detail is really quite enchanting...
