<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
You must defeat the <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum guerrillas, raiders, marksmen, sergeants and captains</font>.<br>
As proof that you have defeated them you must bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Axe Insignia</font>, the symbol of the Partisan army. The more insignias you bring, the greater shall be your reward. Since you served under Captain Leopold, you know the rules of proof and rewards, am I right?<br>
Now hurry to the Fortress of Resistance. Deliver the wrath of the Black Lion upon those Ol Mahums!
