<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
We must drive out the undead <font color="LEVEL">specters, sorrow maidens, neer crawlers, neer ghoul berserkers, strains and ghouls</font>. When an undead is destroyed, it leaves behind a handful of ashes. Bring me back those ashes as proof of your victory. The more <font color="LEVEL">ashes of undead</font> that you bring, the greater shall be your reward. Since you served under Captain Leopold, you  know the rules of proofs and rewards, am I right?<br>
Now hurry! Prepare for combat and leave for the Execution Grounds immediately. Prove that the undead are no match for the Black Lion guild!
