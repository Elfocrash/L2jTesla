<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
As I said, our mission is to drive out the evil spirits in this area. However, since the bulk of our military has been dispatched to Gludio our defensive forces are suffering a shortage. We are only just managing to keep the evil spirits at bay. I will hire as many tough-skinned fighters as I can find!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 25 or above.)
