I know of a society of ancient coin collectors. Once I thought they were collectors of cheap novelty coins, but I have discovered since that the objects of their affection have great value. They will trade very valuable things for coins that strike their fancy! If you are interested in meeting them, you should meet a Dwarf called Sorint in Hunters Village.<br>
