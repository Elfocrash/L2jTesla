How did you know that my hobby was relic restoration? Relics like tablets upon which words are written cannot be deciphered if there is even one piece missing. It isn't worth the effort to put the other pieces together. In my experience, square relics such as stone tablets often break into <font color="LEVEL">four pieces</font>.
