<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
You must go and destroy the <font color="LEVEL">marsh stakatos, including their workers, soldiers and drones</font>. As proof of your victory, bring me their claws. The more claws you bring, the greater shall be your reward. <br>
Now, prepare for combat and set off for the Cruma Marshlands immediately. Let those filthy stakatos feel the wrath of the Black Lion!
