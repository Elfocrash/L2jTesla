Shall we open the box? This lock should be no problem for me... There we go... That was too easy. Now, what do we have here?<br>
It's Spidersilk Rope! It's a very strong and light rope that is made from the spidersilk that is collected from the tarantula's webs in the Spine Mountain Range. If you take it to a store, you should be able to get a very good price for it.<br>
