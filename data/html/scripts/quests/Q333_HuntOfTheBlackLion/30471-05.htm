Do you care to watch the master at work? First, I will attach the legs to the base... Then the torso above that... Now we match the joints of the arms and head properly...  Oh my! I didn't expect that to happen! It just crumbled away... I realize that it was very old and fragile but.. I just applied some light pressure to connect... Oh, I am so sorry!
