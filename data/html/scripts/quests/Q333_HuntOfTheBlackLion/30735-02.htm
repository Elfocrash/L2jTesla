<html><body>Mercenary Captain Sophya:<br>
As I said, our mission is to drive the evil spirits from this area. Unfortunately, the bulk of our military has been dispatched to Gludio. At present we are only succeeding in keeping the demons at bay. I will hire every tough-skinned warrior I can get my hands on!<br>
Say, you seem like you have a lot of experience fighting evil spirits! You would certainly qualify to join our troop...Would you be interested in taking the test to join us? If so, go and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Captain Leopold in Gludin</font>. Once you pass the test and bring back the Black Lion Mark, you will be initiated as one of our brothers and given the opportunity to join in the fight.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character possessing the "Black Lion Mark".)
