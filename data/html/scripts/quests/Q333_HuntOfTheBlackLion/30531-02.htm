Oh my! This Clay Tablet... Where in the world did you find this? Of course its just a fragment, but... Maphr...!<br>
Look at this! If you can obtain the other pieces  and assemble them into a single tablet, I shall reward you handsomely! I promise this in the name of the First Elder of the Guild Federation!
