Hey friend, did you say that you are on active duty?  I salute your honorable service!  Is there anything I can do to help?<br>
What kind of box is that...? Oh, I recognize it now. That's a Cargo Box used by traders. Since you brought it to me I assume you have no intention of returning it to its owner, am I right? Yes, I see. Of course I'll open the box for you and give you the contents. I will charge you a small fee for my service. I think <font color="LEVEL">650 adena</font> will be appropriate. Think of it as the cost of opening the box and keeping my mouth shut.<br>
