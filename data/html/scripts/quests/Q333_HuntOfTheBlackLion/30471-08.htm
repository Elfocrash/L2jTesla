<html><body>Blacksmith Rupio:<br>
Would you care to watch the master at work? Let's see, this fragment attaches to the bottom of the tablet... And this piece goes above that... Oh no! Why did it crumble like that? I suppose that it deteriorated from so many years exposed to the elements... I should have been more careful! How could I have been so careless! My most sincere apologies.
