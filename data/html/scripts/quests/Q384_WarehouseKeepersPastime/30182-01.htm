Being a warehouse keeper can be very boring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.</font> I usually pass the time playing <font color="LEVEL">bingo</font> with other warehouse keepers. On my day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingo with them.<br>
But we find the old rules of the game too boring...<br>
