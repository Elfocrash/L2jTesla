<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
Some time ago <font color="LEVEL">a cargo wagon from Hunters Village was attacked by evil creatures</font> and all of the cargo was stolen. Most of it wasn't very valuable, but a large quantity of <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper's Medals that I was expecting</font> were among the cargo.<br>
You may wonder why I was expecting such a large shipment of medals... Well, you see... Recently while playing bingo with some warehouse keeper friends of mine, I won big time. I did so well, in fact, that I couldn't carry all of my winnings home with me! I asked them to send the medals with their next shipment of cargo. And now this!<br>
Will you help me to recover the medals? If you do this for me, I will reward you generously.
