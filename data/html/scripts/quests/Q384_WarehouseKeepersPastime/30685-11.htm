I've arranged 9 numbers on the panel. Don't peek! Ha ha ha!<br>
Now give me your 10 medals. Some players run away when they realize that they don't stand a good chance of winning. Therefore, I prefer to hold the medals before the game starts. If you quit during game play, you'll forfeit your bet. Is that satisfactory?<br>
Now, select your first number.<br>
