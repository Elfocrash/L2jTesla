I've learned the hard way that I should get your payment in advance. Some players run away when they realize that they don't stand a chance of winning the game. If you quit during game play, you will forfeit your wager. Is this agreeable?<br>
Now select 6 numbers between 1 and 9. Pick your first number.<br>
