<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Cliff:<br>
Being a warehouse keeper can be very boring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.</font> I usually pass the time playing <font color="LEVEL">bingo</font> with other warehouse keepers. On my day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingo with them.<br>
I recently had a problem at a game, and would really like to ask you to help me, but I'm afraid you aren't yet up to the task. Come back when you've improved your abilities.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 40 and above.)
