<html><body>High Priest Hollint:<br>
I understand your intention. May Einhasad's light guide you! Pay careful attention to what I am telling you now. Many magisters have seen ill omens in the constellations and heard the whisperings of spirits.<br>
It is clear that some malicious intelligence is also trying to foment discontent among the tribes, not that they need much prodding to leap at each others' throats. At the recent council of high priests and grand magisters, all of us agreed that all these signs warn of great impending evil that will scar the entire land.<br>
Our only hope is to gain the trust of the other races in order to combine our strengths to survive the <font color="LEVEL">Time of Chaos</font> that looms before us. To rebuild trust between the races, we have decided to dispatch a delegate representing the Human race, who will take our message to the leaders of each race. The king himself has approved this plan. And we are entrusting this <font color="LEVEL">Testimony of Trust</font> to you; you are our delegate. As a representative of the Human race, you must meet with the leader of each race, convey our message and receive their oath of trust in return.<br>
Take these two pages and meet the leaders of both the Elves and Dark Elves. Start by visiting <font color="LEVEL">Elven Magister Asterios</font>.<br>
Accept also this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
