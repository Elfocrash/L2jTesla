Please gather the 3 materials that I requested. Should I explain it again? I have noticed that those of your race tend to be easily distracted by their inborn anger and forgetful of details.<br>
Hunt <font color="LEVEL">the guardian basilisk</font> in the Death Pass and collect 10 bottles of its blood. This will make <font color="LEVEL">Basilisk Plasma</font>.<br>
In the Wastelands you must hunt <font color="LEVEL">the soldier ant</font> and from the 10 aphids you can extract <font color="LEVEL">Honey Dew</font>.<br>
Last, from <font color="LEVEL">the swamp stakato</font> of Cruma marshland gather 10 bottles of the creature's bodily fluids and you'll get <font color="LEVEL">a Stakato Ichor</font>.
