Thank you. It is hard to determine from their response whether we have truly earned their trust, but this is an important first step towards establishing a better relationship.<br>
Now it is time for you to attempt to recover the trust of the Orcs and Dwarves. First, meet with <font color="LEVEL">Cardinal Seresin</font> of this town. He is one of many who are working to recover trust between the races. He will be helpful to you.
