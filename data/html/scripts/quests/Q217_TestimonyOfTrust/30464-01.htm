I don't understand why the Tetrarch would ask an outsider like you to do a job such as this. I have always carried out the rules with loyalty and have never doubted Tetrarch Thifiell's wisdom, I don't intend to start now. Therefore, against my better judgement I will help you. You must gather the following materials:<br>
First, go to the Death Pass and gather the blood of <font color="LEVEL">the guardian basilisk</font>. 10 bottles of blood is just enough for a <font color="LEVEL">Basilisk Plasma</font>.<br>
Also, from the Wasteland, gather 10 aphids which you will obtain by killing <font color="LEVEL">soldier ants</font> Once you do this, you'll be able to get the <font color="LEVEL">Honey Dew</font>.<br>
And last, from the Cruma marshland of Dion, catch <font color="LEVEL">the swamp stakato</font> and collect 10 bottles of their bodily fluids. With this <font color="LEVEL">a Stakato Ichor</font> will be made. When these 3 things are ready bring them back to me.
