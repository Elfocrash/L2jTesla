<html><body>Seer Manakia:<br>
Recently a delegation from the Neruga tribe were savagely attacked by a pack of wild boars as they were traveling to Aden Castle! These bestial boars are called the <font color="LEVEL">windsus</font>, and are known to live around Death Pass in Northern Giran.<br>
Long ago, the Lota tribe, whose totem was a wild boar, was annihilated there. After the slaughter, their totem was buried alive on the spot. It appears that his spirit has possessed the wild boars in the area! Some brave warriors from the Hestui tribe gave their lives to give us this information.<br>
Can you help us? Kill the windsus and you'll find a small parasitic insect in their flesh. This is the <font color="LEVEL">Parasite of Lota</font>, and is apparently the cause of the boars' behavior. Collect 10 parasites and bring them to me.
