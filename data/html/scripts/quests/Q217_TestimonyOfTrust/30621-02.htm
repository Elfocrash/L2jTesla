<html><body>Maestro Nikola:<br>
I want to find out how the Core works. I should be able to do this with some help from you...<br>
Among the creatures inside the Cruma Tower is one called <font color="LEVEL">Porta</font> who is thought to be a golem. Magic and spirits... We Dwarves don't know much about such things, but when it comes to 'artificials' like golems we know them better than anybody else. I think we shall find something if we inspect inside of Porta... To do this we need a sample of the heartstone.<br>
Please go into the tower and bring us <font color="LEVEL">10 Heartstones of Porta</font>.
