<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
In the Elven Forest, the spirits of the wind and the trees are becoming vicious. If we can ameliorate the leaders of these spirits we will probably be able to suppress this disturbance...<br>
The Chief of the wind spirit lireins is called <font color="LEVEL">Luel of Zephyr</font>. You can meet her if you follow the <font color="LEVEL">lireins</font>.<br>
And the Chief of the tree spirits is called <font color="LEVEL">Actea Of Verdant Wilds</font>. You will find him if you hunt for the <font color="LEVEL">dryads</font>...<br>
I wish you success. May you have the blessing of the starlight.
