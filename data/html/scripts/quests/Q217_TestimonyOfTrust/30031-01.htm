Welcome, welcome, my friend! It's been such a long time! Ah, it seems like only yesterday that you finished your studies and left to see the wide world. And here you are, all grown up, strong and straight as a reed. My heart sings to see you well! Thanks be to Einhasad!<br>
Hollint told me what a great thing you've done. Repairing broken trust is no simple matter, but if we deal with sincerity and purpose, I think it is possible, with Einhasad's help. Here, take this, my friend. You have truly earned this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Trust</font>.
