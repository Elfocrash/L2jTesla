Trust? Ha! You Humans always rely on the help of others. Could this be a residual effect of your dark past of slavery? Once a slave, always a slave, right? In that case, if you are begging for help, I will not refuse you. However, there is a price that must be paid.<br>
Don't be frightened, it is a simple request. I know better than to ask more from a Human.<br>
Seer Manakia of Giran recently requested that I send soldiers to face the evil spirits that appear in those parts. I dispatched the elite Warriors of the Hestui tribe and have since lost contact with them. Go and find out what has happened to them. Take this letter and go to <font color="LEVEL">Seer Manakia</font> of the Town of Giran.
