<html><body>Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
Trust... How dare you ask for such a thing from us... Remember the infamous betrayer Dasparion? He was of your race! And it was Human Wizards who sealed our leader! How could we possibly trust the Humans? Do you think that all the past injustices can be forgotten with a simple letter? You fool! I will never understand Humans!<br>
...However, we have been expecting the <font color="LEVEL">Chaotic Chronicle</font> as have you. When that dark time arrives we may have to cooperate in order to survive... I suppose that, for such reasons, we should try to recover the trust between our races.<br>
But trust is not something that can be given freely. If you exhibit true sincerity, I'll consider your proposal.<br>
We have tried for centuries to break the magic spell on our Hierarch Mitraell. He is privy to the secrets of Shilen and the <font color="LEVEL">Queen of Destruction</font>, more than anyone else. It is no exaggeration to say that he holds a vital clue to the upcoming Chaotic Chronicle.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">You must collect the research materials regarding the release of our leader.</font> I don't feel bad about asking for your help, since it was your ancestors who sealed our Hierarch. Take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Clayton of Dion Castle Town</font>. He will give you the list of materials to collect.
