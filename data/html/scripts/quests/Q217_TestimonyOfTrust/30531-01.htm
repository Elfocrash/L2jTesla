<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the Head Elder of the Bronze Door Guild, and the First Elder of the Guild Elder Association. Impressive, eh?<br>
What I actually do is humor the old goats in the Seniors Association. So, what brings you here?<br>
