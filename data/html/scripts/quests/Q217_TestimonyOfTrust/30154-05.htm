Thank you. The breath of the wind will clear the forest air and seedlings of new life will spring from the earth. As our Elven Forest slowly recovers from its wounds, so will our trust in Humans recover.<br>
Here is a letter, but you must not expect absolute trust just yet. The future relations between our races depends largely on how Humans behave from now on... We will be watching. Especially young people like you...<br>
By the way, let me guess where you are off to now. I'll wager you are going to try to meet those poor Dark Elves... You must take care. They are not trustworthy.
