<html><body>Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
May the mercy of Shilen be upon you. I am the chosen one of Gran Kain, the Father of shadow, and Shilen, the Mother of the abyss. I speak on behalf of the Hierarch, who was sealed by those hypocritical followers of the light. I represent the senior council that governs the race of darkness. I am Tetrarch Thifiell, who released his captive brothers from their underground exile and recovered the shadow forest from the Elves. Why have you come to see me?<br>
