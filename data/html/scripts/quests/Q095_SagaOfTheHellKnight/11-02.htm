To find the next stone you must defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font> inside the <font color="LEVEL">Four Sepulchers</font>. To enter will not be easy. If you can't form a strong party, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Shrine of the Loyal</font>. There you'll find Halisha's subordinates. Collect 700 of their marks and the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font> will appear.<br>
They include Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights, and Shrine Guards</font>.</body></html>
