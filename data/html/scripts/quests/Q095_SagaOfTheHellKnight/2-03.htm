Good work! Show me the report.<br>
Hmm... This confirms Waldstein was seen with the gang of Death Lords!<br>
It's believed Waldstein is making the Pilgrimage of the Tablet of Vision to become a Hell Knight.<br>
To complete the pilgrimage you must commune with each of six stone tablets. You must have a Resonance Amulet for each tablet. Upon completion of all six you will gain a level.<br>
Follow Waldstein's footsteps to find him. Here's the first <font color="LEVEL">Resonance Amulet</font>. Use it to commune with the Tablet of Vision where he was last seen. The path to follow will then open to you.<br>
