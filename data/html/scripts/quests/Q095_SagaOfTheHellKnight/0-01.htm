<html><body>Dark Knight Mordred:<br>
Hmm... So, you want to be a Hell Knight, eh? I'm glad you came! Well, you'll have to prove yourself by completing a mission! Have you heard of a Dark Avenger named Waldstein? He was sent out some time ago in pursuit of the <font color="LEVEL">Death Lords</font>, and hasn't been heard from since. Please find out what happened to him! It's been rumored that he actually <font color="LEVEL">joined the Death Lords</font>! Our guild is under a lot of pressure to deal with this matter, one way or the other. Will you investigate this for us?<br>
There have been reports that Waldstein was seen in the vicinity of the <font color="LEVEL">Tablet of Vision</font>. You may need to undertake the <font color="LEVEL">Pilgrimage of the Tablet of Vision</font> if you're going to find him...<br>
