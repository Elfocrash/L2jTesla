<html><body>Guard Bayard:<br>
I'm glad you came to me about Waldstein.<br>
Do you remember the massacre of priests in Goddard Castle Town by the Death Lords some time ago? Their pursuers were killed as well. I heard Waldstein was seen traveling with the Death Lords!<br>
I find it hard to believe such a trustworthy man would join them, so I'm investigating this myself.<br>
Being a guard limits my ability to act. Others are afraid of revenge and have quit helping. Your help will ensure that justice will prevail!<br>
By the way...<br>
