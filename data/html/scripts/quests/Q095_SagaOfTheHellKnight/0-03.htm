Will you find Waldstein for us?<br>
As I said, Waldstein's been seen near the Tablet of Vision recently. He's probably paying homage to it... <font color="LEVEL">Join the pilgrims of the Tablet of Vision so you can follow Waldstein. Find out what he's up to.</font><br>
Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Guard Bayard of Goddard Castle Town</font>. He'll tell you what you need to do next. You should take a copy of the guild bulletin with you!</body></html>
