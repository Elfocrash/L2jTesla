<html><body>Trader Katerina:<br>
I am working as a trader now, but actually my expertise is collecting and trading jewels. I find rare jewels by asking favors of travelers like you and sell them at Giran or Aden. Not long ago, I heard that one can find precious jewels at the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font> of Talking Island. It is an elemental stone used by the Elven Mystics or something like that ...<br>
Now that I think about it, the Elven Ruins may be too dangerous for you to go to. I was going to ask you to find me that jewel, but ... If you come across an opportunity later on to explore the Elven Ruins, please come to me. Then I will tell you in detail how to find the jewel there.<br>
