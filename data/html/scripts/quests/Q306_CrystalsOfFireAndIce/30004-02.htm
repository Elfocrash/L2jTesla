I am working as a trader now, but actually my expertise is collecting and trading jewels. I find rare jewels by asking favors of travelers like you and sell them at Giran or Aden. Recently, I found some very interesting information while leafing through old records at the school of magic. It said that the <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Stone of Fire and Ice</font> used by the Elven Mystics a long time ago is on this very island. The place is the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>, which were abandoned a long time ago. Isn't that interesting?<br>
The Elven Ruins are too dangerous for someone like me, but someone like you will probably have no problem. If you find the jewels I am looking for in the ruins, I will give you a generous reward. What do you think?<br>
