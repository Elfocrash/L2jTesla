<html><body>Guard Belton:<br>
I lost my entire family to <font color="LEVEL">the dragon Antharas</font>. Ten years ago, my mother and sister were killed when many of the villages in southern Giran were destroyed by Antharas, and three years ago, when a company was formed by the lord's orders to slay the dragon, my father and brother were drafted as soldiers and sent to Dragon Valley, where they met their death.<br>
I swore on the graves of my family that I would slay the great monster. Everyone tells me it is useless, but I will slay Antharas one day. Surely that is the only way my family's souls will be put to rest?<br>
I have prepared for revenge for the last year. I have sought the advice of many Warriors, and researched documents related to dragons in the library of the Ivory Tower. The famous Dwarf Bounty Hunter Terrin Wyrmslayer, renowned as a dragon hunter, was especially helpful with his advice. Eventually, I decided that the most effective weapon would be an <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font>.<br>
For the last six months, I have daily sworn revenge as I created arrows that will kill Antharas. But because the materials for the arrows are hard to find, I often ask travellers like you to gather materials for me. Can I ask you this favor?<br>
