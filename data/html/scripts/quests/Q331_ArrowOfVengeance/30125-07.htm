Then please continue your efforts. I am certain that my revenge will be complete, thanks to those like you who have come to my aid. The gods control our fates, but I believe that if the will is strong enough and the conviction steadfast, the gods will be moved and allow one's fate to be reforged. One day I will surely shoot an arrow into the heart of Antharas!
