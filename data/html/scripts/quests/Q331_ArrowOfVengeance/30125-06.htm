I understand. This revenge is mine alone, anyway. I cannot rely on the kindness of others forever.<br>
Are you planning to leave again? Then I guess this is goodbye. But a person's future is not certain. Perhaps I may be the one to come to your aid later. Or I may be slain by Antharas without having fulfilled my revenge, and meet my family in the afterlife. The laws of the gods and of fate are truly mysterious.
