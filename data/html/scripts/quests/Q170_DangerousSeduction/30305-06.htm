So you have discovered that Merkenis has cast a nightmare spell on me using this Nightmare Crystal. Well done. Now I can rest peacefully without being haunted by nightmares ... This is all thanks to you! As promised, I will give you your reward.<br>
While you were gone fighting Merkenis, I found out that the culprit was Icarus, of the house of Hardin. So he dares to challenge me, under the protection of Hardin ...<br>
Long ago, I won a bet against Icarus and obtained a magic scroll dear to him. But he does not acknowledge defeat and troubles me with such petty nightmare spells in order to get his magic scroll back ... Now that I know the culprit, I will not stay silent ...
