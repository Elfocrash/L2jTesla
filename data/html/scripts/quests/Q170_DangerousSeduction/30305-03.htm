Have you ever suffered the pain of not being able to sleep? I have lately been plagued every night by <font color="LEVEL">bad dreams</font>. Every night a beautiful woman with fair skin white as snow and hair black as ebony comes to my side and places her blood-red lips near my ear, speaking horrendous and unspeakable things with a hissing voice like a snake that makes my insides burn ...<br>
The strangest thing is, when I wake up, I cannot remember any of her terrifying, chilling stories. I have called upon all of my magic knowledge, but I have yet to find out the identity of the culprit responsible for sending a devil into my dreams. But I have been able to find out the identity of the monster that appears in my nightmare. It is the <font color="LEVEL">succubus</font> named <font color="LEVEL">Merkenis</font>, who makes her home inside of the abandoned School of Dark Arts. I do not know what her purpose is, but I want to escape from this cursed nightmare as soon as I can. Won't you put an end to this spiteful monster for me?<br>
