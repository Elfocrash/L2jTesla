<html><body>Blacksmith Altran:<br>
This time, when I'm making the hammer, I plan to use stone instead of metals like Steel or Damascus. Stone hammers, you ask? No, we haven't gone back to primitive times. The stone I am talking about is not the everyday rock you can find anywhere, but the shards that fall from a golem's body.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Rock golems</font> live in the woods in the northern region of the island, where people seldom stray. They say that golems are magic creatures that were created by Elves that lived on this island long ago. I don't know about magic, but the shards of the golems can be used as a strong, lightweight material. Gather five of these <font color="LEVEL">shards</font> and bring them to me.
