<html><body>Priest Flauron:<br>
Why betray my order? Well, for one thing, I don't think you'll pose any real threat to the order, even if you do get into the temple. We aren't weaklings, you know. In any case, our order teaches self-interest, and this deal serves my interest. You get into the chapel, I get what I want. What do you say?<br>
