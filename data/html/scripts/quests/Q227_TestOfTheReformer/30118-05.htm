<html><body>Priestess Pupina:<br>
A nail was driven into the head of the untamable Mandragora Aruraune to brainwash it. This is, basically, no different from what the Priests do every day, brainwashing ignorant people with their platitudes about light...Or perhaps we are the ones brainwashed...<br>
Now... I want you to meet someone. She is a former Priestess of this shrine who was defrocked after being accused of paganism. When she got into trouble I denied knowing anything about her beliefs. I could not afford to risk my position. If you have the courage of your convictions, you should go and talk to her.<br>
