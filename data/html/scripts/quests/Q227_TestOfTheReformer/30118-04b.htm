I have finally met someone who sees the world as I do! Oh, but speak softly and take great care not to be overheard. The order, after all, bans even talking about matters of this kind.<br>
Here, take this book. Read it in secret and perhaps it will help enlighten you. But first, travel to the Dion Execution Ground. There, perhaps, your questions will be answered if you can defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Nameless Ghosts</font> that wander that cursed place. You cannot permanently defeat them with physical means, so be sure to finish them off with Disrupt Undead magic.<br>
Finally, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
