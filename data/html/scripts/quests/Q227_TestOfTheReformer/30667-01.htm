Glory to Einhasad! You have traveled so far... for this? Thank you so much.<br>
How is my master? Things here are going very smoothly..., too smoothly, in fact. Sometimes I worry. The people here are much more open-minded than elsewhere. We are planning a big assembly in the Elven relics of Talking Island.<br>
First, in preparation, we must hold a memorial service to calm the magical creatures.Could you help us prepare for the service? A piece of bone must be gathered from every undead in the relics. Look at this diagram...<br>
Could you help us, please?
