<html><body>Priestess Pupina:<br>
Why have you come here? I see that you follow the path of service to the Lord as do I... Are you all right? Could it be that you are concerned about a higher level of faith, by any chance?<br>
You seem too young to have such worries... You must continue to seek the truth elsewhere. When you find your way obstructed, come back to see me.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
