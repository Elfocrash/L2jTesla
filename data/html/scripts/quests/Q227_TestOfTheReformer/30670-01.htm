Oh... Did you say that Mother Sla sent you? She must be worried. I'm fine, just working too much... Oh, well, here we are!<br>
You look like you could take care of yourself in a fight.. Hmmm... I put money on a fight and now one of the fighters claims to have a stomachache... Would you be interested in standing in for him? Your opponent would be that Lizardman over there... I've got to tell you, it won't be an easy fight...<br>
What do you say?<br>
