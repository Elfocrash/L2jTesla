I am so very glad that I sent you. I was concerned about Katari having to deal with the Ol Mahums all alone...<br>
By the way, is that Ol Mahum money? It's useless. Just throw it away... .<br>
As you know, I have one more thing that requires your help... Recently, after giving a lecture on the tenet of light, I was approached by a group of Ol Mahums. They had been touched by my sermon and wanted to become my disciples.<br>
I agreed, but I seriously underestimated the firestorm that would erupt from the hierarchy of the church. For their safety we split them into 3 groups, and sent one group to Talking Island, one to the Orc Town of the northern region, and the other to the Dwarven Village.<br>
I haven't heard anything from them in days and I am very concerned... Especially with the recent Ol Mahum campsite incident and all... Could you go and check on them for me?<br>
Take these 3 letters to my Ol Mahum disciples.. First you must go and meet Kakan. She has settled down southeast of Orc Town...
