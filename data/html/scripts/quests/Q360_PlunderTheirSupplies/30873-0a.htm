Have you been to the Cemetery?<br>
It's a dangerous place, where many monsters roam. The neglect of the kingdom has allowed it to fall into ruins. If we incur our ancestors' wrath, we'll have no one to blame but ourselves. You must use extreme care when you go there. I seriously doubt that you will survive.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 52 and above.)
