The answer is in this stone! It's called the Resonance Amulet. If you use the power contained in it, you can understand the god's characters written on the Tablet of Vision. Also, hold the stone and you'll intuitively sense where the tablet is hidden.<br>
Aren't you curious who made this? I don't know yet, but one thing is clear - someone is helping the Dark Elves use the knowledge forbidden by the gods! We can't let this opportunity pass to explore the true power of magic!<br>
Take this stone. I don't need it anymore. Follow the directions given by the stone and you'll find the first Tablet of Vision. Good luck, my friend!</body></html>
