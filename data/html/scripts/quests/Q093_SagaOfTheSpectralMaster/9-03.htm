<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousands reading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of the world and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears. Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Resonance Amulet is...A vision appears...The sixth Tablet of Vision hidden in the wilds. Standing in front of the sixth tablet is the unfamiliar shadow of a human without legs...and the Resonance Amulet, held in his hands, emits a dim light.<br>In an instant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.</body></html>
