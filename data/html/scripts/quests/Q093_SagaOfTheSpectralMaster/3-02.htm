 First you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Messenger Wahkan</font> of the Ketra Orcs.They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br>
 <font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Asefa</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Ketra Orcs has a <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> that we simply must have!<br>
 If things don't go well with the Ketras, you should try the Varka Silenos tribe. They also have a stone. Good luck!</body></html>
