 The power that you felt comes from this small stone that I have. It's the fragment of the fourth Resonance Amulet. To activate it properly, we must find the remainder of the pieces and assemble them.<br>
 The other fragments of the Resonance Amulet are worshiped by the barbarians of this area as the Divine Stone of Wisdom. As far as I know, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos have them. You must gain their trust first and attain the stone by some means or other. But, both tribes are notorious for being rough and belligerent. I don't know which tribe you should approach...<br>
