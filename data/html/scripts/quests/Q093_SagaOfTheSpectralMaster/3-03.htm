 First, meet <font color="LEVEL">Messenger Naran Ashanuk</font> of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to gain their trust!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Udan Mardui</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos has a <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> that we simply must have!<br>
If things don't go well with the Varkas, try the Ketra Orcs. They also have a stone.</body></html>
