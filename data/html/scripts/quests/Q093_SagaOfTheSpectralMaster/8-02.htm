<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousands reading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of the world and yet understand nothing. Before your eyes, a beautiful blonde woman and a knight wearing black armor appear, but soon vanish.<br>
 Slowly, you sense the existance of the next Resonance Amulet... Aden Castle Town... Summoner Noctisse has the Resonance Amulet in her hands. The radiance from the Tablet of Vision begins to diminish.<br>
 The vision slowly fades away, and soon the light from the stone is gone.</body></html>
