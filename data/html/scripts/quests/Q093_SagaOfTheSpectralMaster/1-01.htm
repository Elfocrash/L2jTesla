<html><body>Magister Kamilen:<br>
So you're a friend of Noctisse? You need the medicine to cure her illness, huh? Severe coughing, high fever, chills... I think it's Sea of Spores fever. It's not going to be easy to cure.<br>
What? Grand Magister Fairen gave the poison? Oh, don't listen to everything Noctisse says. He's severely delusional. Do you really think Fairen would try to kill his student?<br>
