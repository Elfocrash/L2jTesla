<html><body>Summoner Noctisse:<br>
Did Fairen send you here? Cough. What is that old man planning this time...?<br>
Are you working to become a Spectral Master like me? Cough, cough... Damn it! Fairen must have fed me some kind of drug. That old man is scared of becoming a has-been. That's why he's trying to stop a young mage with superior skills like me! He's trying to remove me because he's jealous of my talent! You should watch out, too. You'll never know when Fairen attacks! Cough.<br>
I'll help you. We young mages have to stick together, right? Let me tell you about the pilgrimage of tablets. Where should I start?<br>
