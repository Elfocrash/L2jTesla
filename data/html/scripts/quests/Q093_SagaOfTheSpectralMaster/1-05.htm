 I need some <font color="LEVEL">Ice Crystals</font> from the hot springs area to make the medicine to cure Sea of Spores Fever. I realize it's a lot of trouble, but could you get some for me?<br>
Go to the hot springs area and meet <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font>. Help him get some soy sauce, and he'll tell you where to find the ice crystals. Good luck!</body></html>
