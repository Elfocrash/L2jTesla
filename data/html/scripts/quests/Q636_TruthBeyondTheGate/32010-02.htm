<html><body>Priest Flauron:<br>
As it so happens, you are in luck! Today is Visitor's Day. Excuse me...<br>
(He mutters to the side.)<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Yes, I have just received word from higher up that we need more, so I'm telling them that it's Visitor's Day.</font><br>
(He turns back to you)<br>
How fortunate you are! On Visitor's Day we lavish splendor on our lucky guests; generosity is our watchword. What? Oh, I was just talking to myself, hahaha! Now, here is the <font color="LEVEL">Visitor's Mark we give to visitors</font>. With it, you may pass as safely as an armored saint into the temple! But do not stray from the path; your Visitor's Mark will not help you then, and it is dangerous indeed. Welcome, travelers! Soon you may rest your weary bones, and eat and drink without stint!
