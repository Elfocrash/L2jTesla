<html><body>Priest Eliyah:<br>
Didn't I say I don't want to repeat myself?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Priest Flauron in Rune Township</font> is in charge of finding Human sacrifices for them. Go speak with him and tell him that you're thinking about becoming a Pagan... He'll offer to let you visit the Temple, and will give you what he'll claim is an entrance pass. It's actually a <font color="LEVEL">Sacrifice Mark</font>! It will get you inside the Temple easily enough, but once you're inside those lunatics will set upon you at once with spears and knives! There's no way that you could stand against this onslaught alone...<br>
Many people have been deceived by Flauron and ended up as live sacrifices. You should probably take some trusted comrades with you, but I heard that the Pagans have a strange technique for scattering the forces of outsiders. Be very careful!
