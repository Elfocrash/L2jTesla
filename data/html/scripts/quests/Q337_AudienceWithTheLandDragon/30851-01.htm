Please come in! I trush Gabrielle's judgement but still I'd like to test you myself. I don't want the responsibility of a needless death on my conscience. If you wish to receive my Mark of Watchman, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">Harit Lizardman matriarchs and shamans</font> and bring me proof. They aren't as formidable as Antharas but are worthy opponents. You should gather a party to confront the lizardmen.
