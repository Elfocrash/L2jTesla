<html><body>Blacksmith Helton:<br>
At long last, Gabrielle has sent someone.<br>
I belong to the Black Anvil Guild but originally trained as a seal guardian under Filaur of the Gray Pillar Guild. You may not know this, but recently a decisive battle was fought between our brave warriors and the Succubus. They were trying to free Antharas, the Land Dragon that is imprisoned by an underground aura in the Spine Mine region. One of our allies, Tuwang Raldo, managed to delay their evil plans, but the Succubus escaped and are plotting once again to free the beast.<br>
They are attempting to use an <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Jewel</font> to destroy the aura that restrains the Land Dragon.<br>
