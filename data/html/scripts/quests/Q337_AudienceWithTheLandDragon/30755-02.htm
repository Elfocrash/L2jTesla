Yes, I see that you obtained the Herald of Slayer from Gabrielle. Unfortunately I can't give you a Portal Stone right now. You see, we are in the midst of a critical situation! The force field that is restraining Antharas is being compromised. Please go and see <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Gilmore</font> at the entrance to Dragon Valley. He will be able to tell you more about the situation. When we get the shield restored I will give you a Portal Stone...
