I am one of the guardians of the seal of the Emperor of Light Shunaiman that restrain the evil creatures of Shilen. We recently had a meeting of grave importance. We are now threatened by one of the most fearsome of all evil creatures! The tyrant of the land, the disaster of Giran, the dragon Antharas! He has at last awoken from his deep slumber. We expect him to emerge from his lair at any moment and have decided to strike preemptively. Even now we are forming an expedition to destroy Antharas!<br>
