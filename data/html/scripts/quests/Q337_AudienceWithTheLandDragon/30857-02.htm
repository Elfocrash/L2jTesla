You have accomplished much... Hopefully your efforts will begin to soothe the resentment of those who were punished for the evil actions of our ancestors...<br>I hereby bestow upon you the Mark of Watchman. Even if you do not survive your encounter with Antharas, you will enter the next world having redeemed the sins of our ancestors. May the light of Einhasad guide your way.
