Oh... Your bravery is impressive but Antharas is much stronger than any creature you've come up against. Dragons are fearsomely powerful creatures! They aren't even afraid of the gods! From ancient times countless brave warriors have lost their lives to this menace. I'm afraid you would join them...<br>
An untrained Warrior could unintentionally make matters worse by rousing the beast from his lair and then being instantly killed. If you truly wish to join the expedition, you must complete a task given by the guardians and prove your ability to confront Antharas. Once you do that, you'll be able to pass the force field that guards the lair of Antharas.<br>
