Did Gabrielle send you? Well, in that case I won't waste your time with a long explanation. You must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Forsaken Plains</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">marsh stalkers and marsh drakes</font>. You must be able to defeat them if you intend to even meet the guardians of Antharas at the entrance of Dragon Valley. You should make sure that all the others in your party are aware of this. They should talk to me. If they don't, they shall never qualify to join your expedition.
