Great job! With that kind of strength you may even have a 1% chance of survival! Even if you don't kill Antharas at least you can delay his complete awakening. I would tell you to run away if the battle takes a turn for the worse, but the lair of Antharas is fashioned in such a way that once you enter you cannot leave... Anyway, here is my Mark of Watchman. If any of your colleagues lack the Mark of Watchman for killing marsh stalkers and marsh drakes, you must show them how to obtain it.
