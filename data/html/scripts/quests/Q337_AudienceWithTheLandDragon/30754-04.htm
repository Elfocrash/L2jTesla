There is an evil power growing in the valley. Unless you destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Jewel</font> immediately, the beast will awaken! You must kill all of the <font color="LEVEL">cave keepers and cave maidens</font> and then destroy the Abyss Jewel! Take what remains of the jewel to <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Theodric</font>. You will find him at the entrance of the Lair of Antharas in the deepest part of Dragon Valley.
