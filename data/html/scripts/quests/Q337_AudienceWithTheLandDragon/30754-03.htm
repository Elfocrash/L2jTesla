<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
The Abyss Jewel is guarded by <font color="LEVEL">cave keepers and cave maidens</font>. Through their sorcery they have made the jewel invisible... As you kill them, the power of their sorcery will be diminished and the jewel will become visible once more.<br>
You must destroy it and then find <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Theodric</font>. He will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Portal Stone</font>. You will find him at the entrance of the Lair of Antharas, in the deepest part of Dragon Valley.<br>
If you plan to take any friends with you, send them to see me first. They will need Portal Stones as well.
