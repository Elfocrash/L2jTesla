Originally seventeen guardians participated in the sealing of Antharas. Seven Humans, three Elves, five Dwarven Artisans and two Orc soldiers. The Dwarves formed the Gray Pillar Guild and taught generations of guild members how to guard the pillar that supports the force field. The three Elves were sisters named Shyslassys, Gorr and Baraham. They consumed runestones containing the power of the force field and chose to become evil beings themselves. Three of the seven Humans sold their souls to Dasparion to achieve immortality and became the "Watchmen of the Land Dragon." The other four Humans passed on the role of watching Antharas to their children. I am one of them.<br>
