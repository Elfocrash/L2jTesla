Ah, the Feather of Gabrielle... So you seek the Mark of Watchman? It pains me to have seen so many fine young warriors throw themselves into the jaws of that beast Antharas... What a waste...<br>We have suffered long under that tyrant. So you think that you are the one to finally kill it? It is said that the gods sent Antharas to torment us as punishment for the evil actions of our ancestors.<br>Have you heard this story? Before the force field was set up to confine Antharas, our ancestors sacrificed virgins to the dragon every year. To mock us, Antharas used black magic to transform the virgins into evil creatures called bloody queens. To this day, those wretched beings have cursed the Humans that sacrificed them.<br>If you wish to confront Antharas, you must first redeem our selfish ancestors. East of this village you will find an area called the Seal of Shilen. You must kill the <font color="LEVEL">bloody queens</font> that roam that area. Once you do that, the <font color="LEVEL">malignant spirits of sacrifice</font> will appear. Give them the repose of death and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">remains of sacrificed virgins</font>. When you do that, I shall perform the repose of soul mass to give eternal peace to the souls of the virgins.
