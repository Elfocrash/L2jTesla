<html><body>Head Blacksmith Newyear:<br>
Oh, don't you worry about getting this for free. Nothing's for nothing, you know. In fact, you will need to fetch me every single piece of material required to make it! But it'll be worth the effort, I promise you. You can't buy this kind of armor in a store.<br>
First, you must defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Brun Lizardmen</font> to the <font color="LEVEL">south of the village</font>, and then bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 bottles</font> of their <font color="LEVEL">blood</font>. Their blood is the activator in the epoxy I use for the armor. Go, make haste!
