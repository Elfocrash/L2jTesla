Go to the <font color="LEVEL">southwest of the village</font> and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Piccat Arachnids</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">8 Arachnid legs</font> as proof. <font color="LEVEL">But here's the catch: you must defeat the Piccat Arachnid while your sponsor is watching.</font> I think this is the perfect chance for you to show your sponsor how much you've grown. And, just in case you get into some trouble, your sponsor's presence may be very beneficial. Whatever happens, I believe this will be beneficial to your mutual relationship.<br>
I will work on the armor while you go to confront the Piccat Arachnid.
