Say, you may not have heard, but there is <font color="LEVEL">a new type of armor available that's only for members of a clan academy</font>. Would you like to have a suit of it? I can make one for you...<br>
Oh, wait, I fear you don't meet the prerequisites. I'm sorry.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a sponsored clan academy member of level 19 and above.)
