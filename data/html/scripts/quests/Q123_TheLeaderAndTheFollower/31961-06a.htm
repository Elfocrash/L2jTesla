Go ask your <font color="LEVEL">sponsor</font> to bring <font color="LEVEL">922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Come, now, don't make a long face. These crystals are integral to the process of making the armor. I can't afford to supply them for free - this isn't a charity, you know.<br>
What's that you say? You don't have a sponsor? Oh, for crying out loud! Why didn't you tell me that before wasting my time? Come back and see me again after you find a sponsor.
