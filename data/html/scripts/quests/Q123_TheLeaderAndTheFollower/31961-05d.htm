Very well, heavy armor then. But I don't think you have the number of D-Grade Crystals I'll need for this; you're far too inexperienced.<br>
Perhaps you could ask your <font color="LEVEL">sponsor</font> to bring <font color="LEVEL">922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Come now, don't make a long face. These crystals are integral to the process of making the armor. I can't afford to supply them for free - this isn't a charity, you know.<br>
Oh, yes, one other requirement: <font color="LEVEL">you will have to accompany your sponsor here.</font> Otherwise, if he comes here alone, how in the world will I know he's your sponsor?
