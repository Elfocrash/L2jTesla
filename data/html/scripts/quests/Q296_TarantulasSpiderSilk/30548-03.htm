Spinnerets are the organs within the tarantulas' bodies that store the Spider Silk. Usually one can spin about fifteen skeins of Spider Silk from one Spinneret, but I can easily spin much more than that! If I'm lucky, I can spin over twenty skeins! Ha Ha Ha!<br>
Here! All done! Hurry up and take these to Mion!
