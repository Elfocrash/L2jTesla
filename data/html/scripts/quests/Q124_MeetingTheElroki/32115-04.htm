Unfortunately, all I could discover was when the medicine existed. So I asked the shaman Karakawei to summon the spirits of the Elrokians of that time and ask them where the medicine is.<br>
Karakawei knew the risk, but for my sake he attempted to summon our ancestors' spirit. For many days, his efforts were in vain, but finally he was able to contact a spirit who possessed knowledge of the medicine's whereabouts. Since then we've been anxiously waiting for an adventurer with the courage and skill to recover it for us.<br>
There is not a moment to spare! Please go straight to Karakawei -- you'll probably find him praying around the barracks. After you've obtained the medicine, please return to me at once. In the meantime, I will attempt to discover the cause of this illness while protecting my father from the riots.
