Is this the mysterious medicine? Blessed are you, Shilen! Thank you, my friend. Now we must wait to see if it is Shilen's will whether my father recovers or perishes.<br>
Whatever the result, you will be a friend of the Elroki forever, always present in our hearts and welcome at our hearts.<br>
If my father's health does improve, as I believe it will, I know he will wish to speak with you again.
