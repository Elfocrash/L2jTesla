Friend of the Elroki, be welcome here. You need not tell me who you are or why you are -- the ancestors surrounding me have already told me that you are the outsider destined by fate to save the Elroki tribe from the evil facing it.<br>
Outsider, my ancestors wish to convey a message to you through me. Are you ready to hear it?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest Q124_MeetingTheElroki 32117-02.htm">Say that you are ready.</a>
