I don't know... His son Asamah wrote that he thinks he has found a cure, but needs a strong young adventurer to obtain it.<br>
Were I younger, I would go myself...but I know in my heart that this is a task for another. If I cannot go, though, I will at least send someone worthy of this trust, one who can help me repay the life-debt I owe Mushika.<br>
Will you go and help? You will find Mushika and his son Asamah in the Elrokian tribal chief barracks located southeast of the Primeval Plains. To get there, though, you will need help of a native warrior named <font color="LEVEL">Orahochin</FONT> who lives near the foot of the mountain that lies between the southern shore of the Primeval Plains and the Lost Nest. When you get to the Elroki camp, visit <font color="LEVEL">Mushika</FONT> first if possible, but do not forget to speak with <font color="LEVEL">Asamah</FONT> as well.
