<html><body>Priest Petron:<br>
So you came to such a remote island to find the true religion of Einhasad...<br>
I came here many years ago after I incurred the hatred of the High Priests. Apparently I was trying to clarify the truth too specifically. Anyway, I much prefer the liberal atmosphere here over the corrupt inner circle.<br>
...I have so much to tell you. But first I have a favor I must ask... Please get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">malignant spirit Nahir</font> coiling in the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>. This will enhance your learning. Please, will you deal with Nahir?
