All right, I'll tell you. People only care about their own interests and are all too ready to spread false myths to further their own ends. I'm sure that the myths you know are no different . . . My advice is to forget everything you've learned so far and re-learn the story of the gods all over again, from the begining. Do you think you can do it?<br>
Wait, before you answer, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font> first. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.<br>
Now, will you answer me?<br>
