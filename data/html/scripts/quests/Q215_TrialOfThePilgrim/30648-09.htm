<html><body>Hermit Santiago:<br>
Do you understand? You must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Seer Tanapi of the Orc Village, Gauri Twinklerock of the Dwarven Village, Father Primoz of Giran Castle Town, and Andellia of the Elven Village</font>! In that order! Discern from them their ideas on the nature of the gods... You may find this trial unsettling and shocking, but as a seeker of the truth you must endure.
