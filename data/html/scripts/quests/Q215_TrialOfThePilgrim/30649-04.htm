So hot! So hot! My body feels as if it will burst into flame. Aieee!<br>
Wait... what's this? The Flame of Combative Spirit? Truly, this is the mind possessed by the warriors of old...<br>
What is that, there in the distance? What do my old eyes perceive? Oh! Oh! Stay away! The heat, the heat! Ah! Ah, I see... Is this the Flame of Destruction, which engulfs everything in its path and leaves only black ashes?<br>
Is this the end? ...<br>
No, there is something more! I see a small flame burning bright in the ash. It is the one — the most sacred flame of all! It is the Flame of Life, the vital energy that moves the whole world...<br>
(O insignificant creature, would you venture to see and hear more of my mind's thoughts? You cannot! Your frail mortal frame cannot bear more of this inferno! Farewell!)
