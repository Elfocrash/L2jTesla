At this time of day you will probably find <font color="LEVEL">Priest of the Earth Gerald</font> near the entrance of the village counting his money. He is somewhat irritable when he is busy so don't bother him too much. <font color="LEVEL">Wanderer Dorf</font> can probably be found at the opposite end of the village. You can bother him as much as you like.
