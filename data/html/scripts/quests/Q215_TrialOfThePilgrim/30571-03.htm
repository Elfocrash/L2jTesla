That is quite a surprise! You say that you felt the flames of Pa'agrio? Amazing!<br>
To tell you the truth, I wasn't very hopeful when I sent you to the Cave of Trials. These days, success seems rare from one so young as you... I shall remember this.<br>
So you want to learn about Maphr? You should go and see <font color="LEVEL">Gauri Twinklerock of the Dwarven Village</font>! I hope that you will find the light of truth at the end of your journey! Tejakar Pa'agrio!
