Maphr, the goddess of abundance and prosperity?! Foolish cattle, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarves in this town. They are mentally unbalanced, always dashing here and there to collect some more money. They are simply ridiculous! Miserable creatures who would even rip out their goddess' heart if it were worth money! And they don't hesitate to unearth things that should not be part of this world!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Maphr is indeed the goddess of abundance and prosperity, but that also means that she is responsible for all poverty and downfalls! Why can't you see this simple fact!</font> They have already experienced bankruptcy once before... Tsk tsk...<br>
By the way, what is that book you are holding? You bought it from Gerald? <font color="LEVEL">You fool! You have been deceived by him!</font> Show him this badge. You might be able to get your money back.
