Did you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you? Your timing could not be better.<br>
I have a favor to ask. There is a Priestess named <font color="LEVEL">Uruha</font> in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as <font color="LEVEL">Black Willows</font>. You must destroy these spirits.<br>
The Black Willows are located near the <font color="LEVEL">Waterfalls in the northern part of the Neutral Zone</font>. After destroying them, <font color="LEVEL">go to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest ever again.</font> After you do this we can discuss what you seek.
