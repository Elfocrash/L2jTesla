Shouldn't you be on you way to the <font color="LEVEL">ancestors' altar</font> in the Cave of Trials? You must go there and pray to <font color="LEVEL">Ancestor Martankus</font>.<br>
What, are you afraid now? If that's the case I wouldn't blame you. Just go back and tell Santiago that you are too scared to complete the task...
