<html><body>Master Luther:<br>
Have you come for the Mark of the Searcher? This mark is reserved for those who's ability for 'finding hidden things' is recognized. Every year, many Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of taking the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>, but you do not have enough experience. Come back after you have improved your abilities.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
