This Malrukian Wine is of the highest quality. It was made by distilling the spider's poison. The secret recipe is only inherited by the chosen ones, even amongst the Dark Elves. I cannot give it out freely.<br>
I shall make you a proposition. If you will find <font color="LEVEL">10 pouches of the Red Spore Dust</font> I shall trade the wine for them. What do you say? Is this acceptable?<br>
