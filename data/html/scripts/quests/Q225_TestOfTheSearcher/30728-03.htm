Thank you so much for your help! One more thing... Apparently the delu lizardmen do not intend to attack the village... They seem to be looking for something... What could be so precious that the whole tribe would be looking for it? I am sure that <font color="LEVEL">Delu Chief Kalkis</font> knows something. Could you please go find out what he knows and then kill him? If you follow the path that heads towards the East, you will run into him.
