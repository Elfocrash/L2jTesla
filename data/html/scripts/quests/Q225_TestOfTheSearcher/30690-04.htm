Have you come for the Mark of the Searcher? This mark is reserved for those with recognized detection skills. Every year, many Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of taking the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>, but a Dwarf like you? Do you happen to be a Bounty Hunter applicant? They are reputed to be the best Hunters among the Dwarves. But even within the Dwarf Guild, such titles are rare... It is said that only those who have proven their hunting skills and acquired the Mark of the Searcher are qualified to be a Bounty Hunter. If you wish to take the examination, I will gladly arrange it for you.<br>
