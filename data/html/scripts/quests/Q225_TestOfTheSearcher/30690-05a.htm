<html><body>Master Luther:<br>
Visit <font color="LEVEL">Alex in Floran Village</font>. Once the best scout in the kingdom, he served as King Cadmus' special messenger and spy during the Grecian War.<br>
Disenchanted by the nobility by their actions during the peasant revolt, he now fights alongside the Floran militia. I have heard that he is hard pressed for supplies and manpower, though. Go see him.<br>
If he evaluates you and is satisfied, he will let me know.<br>
Oh, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
