Ha, I guess Alex grew somewhat attached to you... At the end of the Recommendation letter he joked that he would like me to come up with a reason to send you back to him. I heard that you recovered Ashton's gold from the delu lizardmen! That must have been interesting...<br>
So how about it, would you like to go back to see Alex? Ha, just kidding!<br>
Here is the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Searcher</font>. Thank you for the good work you have done!
