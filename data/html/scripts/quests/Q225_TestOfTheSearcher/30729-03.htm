Ahh... This is it! Outstanding! My tongue is loosed by the fragrant nectar...<br>
Obviously the Lord's gold was being transported from Gludin to Dion. The 4 royal Guards carrying the gold schemed to hide it away... The Lord unsuccessfully pursued them. Somehow people got the idea that they perished in an accident..<br>
Actually, one of them, named Rovelt, is still alive. Now he goes by <font color="LEVEL">Bodyguard Jax</font> and guards the Dwarf traders. He is probably somewhere in <font color="LEVEL">the southern part of the Wastelands</font> now. He will tell you everything if show him this. Take it and go, my young friend.
