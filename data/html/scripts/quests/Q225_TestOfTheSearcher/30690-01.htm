Have you come for the Mark of the Searcher? The Mark is reserved for those with proven detection skills. Every year, many Hunters, Scouts, Excavators and even some Assassins come to me in hope of taking the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Searcher</font>, though you seem different from them... Are you sure that you are in the right place?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by Human Rogue, Elven Scout, Assassin, or Scavenger.)
