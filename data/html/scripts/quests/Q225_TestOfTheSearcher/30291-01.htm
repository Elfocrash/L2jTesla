Welcome, my friend. If Master Luther sent you here you must be ready to get to work.<br>
Floran Village needs more good workers like you. We don't have a guard or even a single skilled person!<br>
I have been waiting for you since I received the warrant of appointment. Take this and give it to my adjutant <font color="LEVEL">Militia Leirynn</font>...<br>
She is a modest lady. I am afraid that work here may not be as easy as you think... I thank you in advance.<br>
