<html><body>Master Luther:<br>
First you must visit <font color="LEVEL">Alex in Floran Village</font>. He was once the kingdom's best Scout, and is famous for his activities as King Cadmus' immediate spy and messenger during the war with Gracia.<br>
But he grew disillusioned by the royal family and aristocrats at the time of the peasant's uprising and joined the militia corps of Floran. I have heard that they are lacking soldiers and supplies. Go and see him.<br>
Alex will test you and write a letter of Recommendation for you if you qualify.
