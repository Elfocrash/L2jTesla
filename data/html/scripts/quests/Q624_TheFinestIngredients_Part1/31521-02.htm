<html><body>Chef Jeremy:<br>
I plan to prepare smoked yeti meat for the competition, but I won't use just any ordinary yeti meat! I must have the meat of the king of the yetis! Also known as the Icicle Emperor, he's very rarely seen.<br>
First, I must make a special dish to lure him out.<br>
Bring me the secret recipe spices extracted from hot springs nipensiz stems, soles of Hot Springs Bandersnatches, Hot Springs Atrox and Hot Springs Atrox spawn. I'll need fifty of each!<br>
Why so many? Ha! This is the king of the yetis we're talking about here! He's a big eater and won't come out for an ordinary portion!<br>
I'll start preparing now. Bring me the ingredients as soon as possible!
