Oh no!<br>
I've got a serious problem! That newcomer Donath plans to participate in the culinary contest, and from what I've heard, he's my only real competition!<br>
What can I do to beat him? I've got it! But the ingredients won't be easy to find...<br>
Hey, you! Yeah, you! I hate to ask you this, but do you want a job? I'm the greatest chef in this region, and I'm preparing to make the most fabulous dish of all time!<br>
Help me gather the ingredients and <font color="LEVEL">I'll give you an Ice Crystal</font>!<br>
