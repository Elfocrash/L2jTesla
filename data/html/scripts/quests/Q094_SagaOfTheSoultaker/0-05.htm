In order for a Necromancer to become a Soultaker, you must shed your mortal perspective and attain the consciousness of the gods. Long ago, the gods sealed this power and dispersed it throughout the world in order to keep Humans from reaching their full potential. You must reclaim this long-denied knowledge one tablet at a time.<br>
The Tablets of Vision hold the secret to this power. Find all six tablets and you will become more powerful than you can imagine. All Soultakers must complete the Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision.<br>
Keep an eye out for Hindemith while you're at it... I've heard rumors that he's joined forces with Lich King Akron!<br>
