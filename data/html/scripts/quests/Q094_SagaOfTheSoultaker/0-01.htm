So, you want to be a Soultaker, eh? Well, you came at just the right time! First, you must accomplish a task to prove that you're worthy. Have you met a necromancer by the name of <font color="LEVEL">Hindemith</font>? He was sent to spy on the followers of <font color="LEVEL">Lich King Akron</font>, but it's been rumored that <font color="LEVEL">he's become a follower of that wicked despot</font>! I haven't heard from him at all since the rumors started. Our guild is under increasing pressure to deal with Hindemith, one way or the other. Would you look into this matter for us?<br>
He's been seen around the <font color="LEVEL">Tablet of Vision</font>. You should join those who have undertaken the <font color="LEVEL">Pilgrimage of Tablet of Vision</font>. You'll likely find Hindemith among them.<br>
