<html><body>High Priest Gregory:<br>
Asefa is the chief shaman and guide of dead souls of the Ketra Orcs. Udan Mardui holds the same position among the Varka Silenos. Each of them possesses a <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> which is a <font color="LEVEL">fragment of this Resonance Amulet</font>. Bring one of the stones to me.<br>
Both tribes seem vaguely aware that the stone contains powerful magic and mysterious knowledge, but they have no idea how to access it! They actually give it away as a prize to the person they think is smartest among them!<br>
Prove your wisdom to Asefa of the Ketra Orcs or Udan Mardui of the Varka Silenos and they will give you the stone.<br>
Which tribe would you prefer to obtain the stone from?<br>
