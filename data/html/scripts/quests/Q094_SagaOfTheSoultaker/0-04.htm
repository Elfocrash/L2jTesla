Please find out what you can about a necromancer named <font color="LEVEL">Hindemith</font> who's been seen near the Tablet of Vision. A while back he was sent to spy on the followers of Lich King Akron. Word has come to me that he has actually <font color="LEVEL">allied with that wicked despot</font>!<br>
I think Hindemith has undertaken the <font color="LEVEL">Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision</font>. Join that pilgrimage and find out what he's up to.<br>
First, visit <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Gregory in Goddard Castle Town</font>. He'll tell you what to do next. Pick up a guild bulletin on your way out!</body></html>
