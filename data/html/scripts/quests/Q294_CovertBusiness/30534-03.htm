Your job is to collect Bat Fangs. While wandering west of the Mine Field, you will often see <font color="LEVEL">blade bats</font> and <font color="LEVEL">barbed bats</font>. You will hunt them and bring me their <font color="LEVEL">fangs</font>. You need to collect exactly <font color="LEVEL">100</font> fangs.<br>
I don't know what such an odd material is used for, but all we need to do is find the items that our clients want. Our guild members should be able to bring anything, even dragon scales, to our clients. That's our belief.<br>
There's one thing I don't really like about this quest ... the client is <font color="LEVEL">Hardin</font>, who has been branded as a black magician by the Humans. Things could become complicated if anyone finds out that our Guild is dealing with such a notorious person ... I hope you won't talk to anyone else about this. Do you understand what I'm saying?<br>
