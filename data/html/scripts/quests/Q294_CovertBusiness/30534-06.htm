You've done well, my friend. You have brought me 100 Bat Fangs. Magnificent! I can send these to <font color="LEVEL">Hardin's Academy</font> by this week's wagon. As promised, I will reward you for your hard work. This should be enough, no? Our guild's rule is to give appropriate rewards to those who have worked for us.<br>
Actually, I had a cup of tea with Hardin few days ago. Contrary to the rumors, he was a well-mannered, pleasant person. Having a business relationship with such a person is actually investing in the future. We never know when we'll be put into a tight spot, just like when we were attacked by Orcs before ... We need to have few solid allies as a simple precaution, don't you think?
