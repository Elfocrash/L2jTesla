I see. First, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.<br>
Now listen to me carefully. You must <font color="LEVEL">visit each territory of Aden and prove your skill against the best opponents you find</font>. Your task is to <font color="LEVEL">defeat each adversary more than 10 times</font>.<br>
In the past, the swordsman from each territory engaged in bloody mortal combat to prove their skills, but the Warrior Guild has since banned unauthorized duels. That means the adversaries you will face are now limited to evil creatures or different races that threaten the common peace.<br>
