<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>
Greetings, young traveler. I am Duelist Kaien.<br>
The original meaning of the word 'Duelist' was 'Challenger.' It was used to describe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena at Schuttgart. They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that as an honor.<br>
Now this title is given to those whose weapons skills have reached their zenith. It is an honor desired by all that wield a weapon, but only a select few may attain this title, and only after many years of training...<br>
If you wish to obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Duelist</font> you must pass the trial that I, Duelist Kaien, give you.<br>
