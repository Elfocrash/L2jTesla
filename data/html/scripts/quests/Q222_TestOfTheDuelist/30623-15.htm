<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>
So you do not know the meaning of defeat... Good... then you are halfway there! Already you have conquered each territory. Now you must become the champion of each kingdom, that is to say, <font color="LEVEL">'Conquer the Kingdom'</font>... The previous trial may have been difficult, but this time it will be twice as challenging.<br>
The opponent in this trial has been chosen by all the grand masters in the kingdom. You must achieve <font color="LEVEL">3 victories</font> from 1 opponent... That in itself is not an easy task. <font color="LEVEL">If you find it difficult to accomplish alone you may ask your fellow members to assist you</font>. You will still get the credit for a victory should you succeed. Of course, your opponent will be much more difficult...<br>
