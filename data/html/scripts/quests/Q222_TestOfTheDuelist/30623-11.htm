<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>
I personally selected your opponents for the trial in <font color="LEVEL">Oren</font>. First you shall fight the <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardman Overlord</font> that lives in the southern regions of Oren, and your second opponent will be the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Monstereye</font> that wanders the area surrounding the Ivory Tower of Oren. Stay alert, as both are formidable enemies!<br>
Bring back 10 Leto Lizardman Chief's Amulets, and 10 pieces of Enchanted Eye Meat.<br>
