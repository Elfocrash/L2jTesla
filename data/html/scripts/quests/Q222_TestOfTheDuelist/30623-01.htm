<html><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>
Greetings, young traveler. I am Duelist Kaien.<br>
The original meaning of the word 'Duelist' was 'Challenger.' It was used to describe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena at Schuttgart. They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that as an honor.<br>
Now this title is given to those whose skills with the weapon have reached their zenith. It is an honor desired by all that wield a weapon, but only a select few may attain this title, and only after many years of training...<br>
You may also become a Duelist, but that is something to be discussed in the future... To attempt the trials at your skill level would mean certain death... For now, you must suppress your ambition and concentrate on your training.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
