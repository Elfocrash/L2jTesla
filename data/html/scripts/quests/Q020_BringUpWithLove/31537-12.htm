Oh, a Jewel of Innocence! Isn't it beautiful?! See how it sparkles...<br>
Sob! I'm sorry! Just looking at it breaks my heart!<br>
I was so young! So full of hopes and dreams... all but forgotten now...<br>
Now I think I can do it! My dream... to create a world in which everyone understands each other...<br>
I'm not sure how I'll do it, but I'll make it work somehow!
