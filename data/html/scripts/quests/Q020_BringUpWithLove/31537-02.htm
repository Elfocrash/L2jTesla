Aaah... Pastoral scenes like this make me wish I could see these cute lttle critters grow up!<br>
They look cute, but you can never forget that they're wild beasts! There's no way I can handle them all on my own... Do you know anyone who could help me raise them?<br>
It's a very dangerous job! It's not for just anyone...<br>
