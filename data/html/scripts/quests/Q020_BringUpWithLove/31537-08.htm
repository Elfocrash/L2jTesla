Please bring me a Jewel of Innocence. This isn't something you can purchase, or kill something for... You must earn it by raising a beast yourself!<br>
Alas, this is an honor that only comes once in a lifetime... I'll never forget my little beast... And the brilliance of that gemstone!<br>
If only I could possess one again... Could you please bring a Jewel of Innocence to me?<br>
