This looks like a badge from our temple...? Don't tell me... Could it be a relic from the battle against Antharas 1,000 years ago? How could it be?<br>
I have always feared that our efforts to slay Antharas have been in vain. This old badge tells me that our responsibilities cannot be avoided, no matter the cost.<br>Thank you, young traveler. Please take this small token of appreciation from our temple.
