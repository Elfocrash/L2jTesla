<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
Surely you have heard of the untold numbers that have died trying to slay Antharas. The fortunate among them were called back to the bosom of Shilen. The unfortunate ones are now the cave servants. I couldn't begin to tell you how many these are now in the valley. You must simply kill as many as you can. These are several types of cave servants, among them <font color="LEVEL">cave servant archers, cave servant warriors, and cave servant captains.</font> You must kill them all. If they leave any relics behind, please bring them to me. You shall be well-rewarded.
