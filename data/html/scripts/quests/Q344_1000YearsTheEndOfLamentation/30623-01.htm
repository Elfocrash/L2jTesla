This is the first I've heard of that! I'm so sorry, obviously you've gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing... Wait a moment~<br>
Could I take a closer look at that? This design is remarkably similar to the one engraved on a scabbard that I received from my father... I am beginning to believe you now.<br>
I come from a long line of dualists! It has been a tradition in my family for over a thousand years! Charming, no?<br>
Thank you, I will accept this... I wish I had more to offer you in return! Please accept these worthless trinkets as a token of my appreciation!
