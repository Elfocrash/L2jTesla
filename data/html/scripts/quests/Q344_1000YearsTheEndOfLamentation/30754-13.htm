<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
This sword belonged to one of my aides who fought alongside me against Antharas 1,000 years ago. In the intervening years the blade must have rusted away and only this hilt is left. He was a swordsman without parallel...<br>
It is said that one of his descendants is living in <font color="LEVEL">Oren Castle Town</font>. It is likely that he is following the family tradition of being a <font color="LEVEL">Duelist</font>.<br>
I am unable to leave this valley or I would take this relic to him. Would you please do this for me? I will pay you for your trouble.
