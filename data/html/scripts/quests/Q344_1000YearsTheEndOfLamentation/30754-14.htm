<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
This necklace belonged to a soldier that served under my command in the battle against Antharas. He was the finest Orc I've ever known, a true intellectual. Seriously! I'm fairly certain he was of aristocratic birth.<br>
Come to think of it, I've seen that necklace elsewhere. It was worn by an Orc who was a <font color="LEVEL">High Prefect</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Hunters Village</font>.<br>
I would take the necklace to him if I was able to leave this valley, but alas, I cannot. Would you please take it to him? I will compensate you well for your trouble.
