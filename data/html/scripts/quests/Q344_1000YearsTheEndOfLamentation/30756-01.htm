Really! So the ancestors of the Rodemai family participated in the expedition to fight Antharas during the Elmoreden Empire?<br>
Yes, that does sound familiar. My family has always been a self-sacrificing lot... This key proves it. So, how about that?<br>
I appreciate your bringing me something so precious! Here, take this as a token of my appreciation for your hard work.
