<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
My personal aide wore this key around his neck. He stood by my side during the battle with Antharas 1,000 years ago. He was the first-born son in his family... This key was very important to him.<br>
I believe one of his descendants is living in <font color="LEVEL">Giran Castle Town</font>. He has the family name of <font color="LEVEL">Rodemai</font>.<br>
I am bound to this valley so cannot go myself. Would you please take the key to Rodemai in Giran Castle Town? I will pay you for your trouble.
