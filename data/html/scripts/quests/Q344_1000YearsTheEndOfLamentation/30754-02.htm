<html><body>Antharas Watchman Gilmore:<br>
I've not left Dragon Valley since I led my men here so many years ago to battle Antharas...<br>
I have accepted the inevitability of my eternal responsibility to watch over the beast. But my heart goes out to the loyal soldiers who lost their lives due to my stubborn ignorance. I have no other wish than to see their remains returned to their hometowns so they can rest in peace.<br>
