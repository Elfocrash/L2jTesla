It's very simple. There are 70 cards, made up of 5 suits with 14 characters in each suit. You draw 5 cards from the lot, and if you get one of the combination of cards below, you can be rewarded.<br>
Five of a kind: Five cards containing the same character.<br1>
Four of a kind: Four cards containing the same character.<br1>
Full house: Three cards with the same character aLong with two cards with the same character.<br1>
Three of a kind: Three cards with the same character.<br1>
Two pairs: Two pairs of cards with the same characters in each pair.<br1>
One pair: Two cards with the same character.<br>
If you don't have any of the hands I just mentioned, it's called having "no pair", and you don't get anything. Of course, a five of a kind is rare, so the reward for getting it is high; on the other hand, one pair is the easiest hand to get, so you'll receive only the lowest reward.<br>
