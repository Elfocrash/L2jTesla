Are you here because you heard the rumor, too? These days, I spend a lot of my time playing cards with the travelers who pass this way. Naturally, there's plenty of reward for those who play a good game. Feel up to a game?<br>
Of course, since you stand to win a fair amount, you can't play for free. That's why it's a game of chance, eh? If you want to play with me, bring me some of those red gems that have recently caught my eye. Ahh, but I think this task might be a little to much for you to take on right now. Perhaps another time, eh?<br>
