Very well! Now let me give you the details Your job is to wipe out the insolent goblins that have been attacking our Guild freight wagons. Of course, I could hire guard escorts, but under these circumstances I cannot trust anyone except for my guild members.<br>
In the interest of good business, I need proof of your qualifications. All goblins wear <font color="LEVEL">necklaces that represent their rank</font>, so collect them and bring them to me. I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces that you bring. That means, if you bring necklaces that belong to high-ranking goblins, I will reward you even more, understood?<br>
Now! Leave at once! Time is money!
