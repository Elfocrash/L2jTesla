I heard you work for the Golden Wheel Guild ... Is this true?<br>
Oh ... I see. Young friend, let me give you a piece of advice. Spiron is only taking advantage of you. That mean old man is only interested in generating profits for his guild!<br>
Even if you should get hurt or run into trouble while carrying out guild business, don't expect Spiron to help you. He'll only argue that that wasn't in the contract.
