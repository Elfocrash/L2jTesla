Business is bad these days because of the <font color="LEVEL">goblin brigands</font>. The goblins have become so bold that they attack freight wagons now!<br>
The our guild has been taking great losses lately, because only our wagons are being attacked. I am thinking of addressing this brigand issue next month at the Guild Association Elder Council ... But I can't wait that long ...<br>
So, I need to ask you a favor ... Would you like to work for me? If you work for our glorious Golden Wheel Guild, your friends and colleagues will respect you even more. Oh, and of course I will reward you based on your work. Nothing is free for Dwarves. What do you think? Will you give it a try?<br>
