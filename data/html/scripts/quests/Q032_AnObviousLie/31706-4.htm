What are you talking about?<br>
Are you saying <font color="LEVEL">Gentler</font> told you to get the payment for the runestone from me? I never signed such a contract! Our agreement was that I would bring the herbs on time and he would pay me for them.<br>
He probably thought he wouldn't see me again because I wander about so much. Go back to <font color="LEVEL">Gentler</font> and get the reward from him!
