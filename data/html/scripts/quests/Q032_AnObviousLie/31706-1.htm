He did send me the map! Meow~! Thank you for delivering it. I don't have any Moretti's herb for him, I lost it while wandering around. I'll tell you where to get some, though. Will you get it for me? I'm sure Gentler will give you a proper reward. You can get them from <font color="LEVEL">alligators on Alligator Island</font>. They eat the herbs for digestion. Hunt alligators, get 20 herbs and go straight to Gentler when you're done.
