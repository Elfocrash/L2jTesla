<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br>
Long ago, Gludio was consumed in the Burning War when the forces of the Ivory Tower confronted the bastard demon Beleth. Beleth's evil permanently scarred the land, leaving nothing but desolation and waste.<br>
I've been researching ways to restore Gludio to its former beauty. I'm sorry, but you don't look enough experienced for that task.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 26 and above.)
