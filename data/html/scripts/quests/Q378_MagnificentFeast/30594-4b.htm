Hmm.. 30-year-old wine... Not bad... But I think you could've done better... But I'll take it. Let's see, what else was there...?<br>
Ah, yes! A grand feast must be accompanied by entertainment! I've heard that there is a skillful dwarf composer in this village. What was his name? Barmonkey... Barbado... something like that... Anyhow, please find him and ask him to compose some festive music suitable for this occasion. I'll hire a musician myself. Just bring me a musical score.
