<html><body>Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
I've been a warehouse keeper in this very location for almost 40 years! I can honestly say that I built this place with my own hands. I sacrificed my youth and devoted all of my passion to it!<br>I received notice some time ago from the elder council of the guild union in Schuttgart. An inspector from the Iron Gate Guild will visit here soon. He is coming to observe my warehouse because the productivity in Dion has been so high this year. If everything goes well, I might be very well be promoted to the position of elder!<br>
When the inspector is here, I must honor him with a great feast... But I don't know where to start! I'm so excited! I must have some help from an adventurer like yourself. Of course, you'll be well rewarded. What do you think? Will you help me?<br>
