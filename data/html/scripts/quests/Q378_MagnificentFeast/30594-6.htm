<html><body>Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
Appetizer, wine, cheerful music... all that's lacking is the main course... the heart and soul of the feast! We must prepare the courses! I know that the inspector would like to try some of Dion's regional foods. I have provided the young chef's apprentice with space and money to develop dishes... For some reason, it's taking him forever! <font color="LEVEL">Jonas</font> is only interested in winning a prize in the culinary competition. He's not interested in treating the inspector with great dishes at all! He's saying that before he can complete the final dish, he won't tell his secret recipe to anyone! Would you talk to him and try to get his secret recipe?
