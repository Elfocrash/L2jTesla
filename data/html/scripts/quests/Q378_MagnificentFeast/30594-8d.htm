Oh my! Where is Shilen when you need her? She should have taken you long ago! What were you doing when I explained this to you before? Are you deaf? OK, I'll tell you once more. Pay attention! The guy next to me is Jonas! He has a lot of secret recipes. Talk to him, obtain one of his secret recipes and bring it to me!
