<html><body>Guard Harlan:<br>
Apology accepted, my friend... I suppose I overreacted. To mark the birth of my daughter I want to make fantasy wine. The recipe has been in my family for many generations. When she marries I will serve it at her wedding!<br>
I am lacking some of the ingredients I need to make the wine. These ingredients have always been rare, but nowadays it's practically impossible to get them. To make matters worse, my duties as a guard keep me from going out and finding them myself. Would you help me?<br>
