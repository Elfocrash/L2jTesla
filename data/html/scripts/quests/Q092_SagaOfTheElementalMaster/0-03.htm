<html><body>Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
Radyss is resting in Aden Castle Town. I'm afraid he doesn't have much time left. You must start your pilgrimage immediately! Although Elves' lives are practically eternal, we have no time to waste!<br>
Please read this report before you leave. It will tell you all you need to know about the spirit protecting one of the tablets. You must face this challenge bravely. Study the report carefully.<br>
Please, get going! May Eva's light guide your path!</body></html>
