<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>The Tablet of Vision begins to illuminate the room and engulfs you in its wake. Thunderous chanting clogs your mind and yet gives you understand of something.... something that cannot be understood! You hear a familiar woman's voice whispering again...Arden Castle Town...there is Summoner Radyss, who has a bad cough...<br>He lifts up his face and looks into your eyes, motioning you to come toward. Summoner Radyss has the stone! The vision disappears slowly, and the tablet goes dark.</body></html>
