<html><body>Priest Cerenas:<br>
My father sent you here... I just want my father's pain to end. I pray to Eva everyday to let him find relief. This medicine only prolongs his suffering. If you ask me to make the medicine again, it is too painful for me.<br>
However, I cannot go against my father's will. So, become an Elemental Master and help him to find relief and go to the bosom of Eva.<br>
Now, I have to make the medicine. As you might hear from my father, I need a very rare material to make this medicine...<br>
