<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousands reading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of the world and yet understand nothing. Both the absolute understanding, and the absolute ignorance of nature come across at the same time. There is a vision of a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears. Slowly, you begin to visualize where the next Resonance Amulet is...There is Summoner Radyss...He gazes at you and smiles. He may have the Resonance Amulet, but the beam from the stone is much weaker than before.<br>In an instant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.</body></html>
