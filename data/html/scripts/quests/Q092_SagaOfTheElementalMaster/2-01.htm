The young leaf of Mother Tree, you finally came...<br>
(Ack)... This old man has already lived for over 2000 years, and now the day is near when I return to the bosom of Eva. However, I have many things to teach you before I die. It is an obligation and the right way of the last Elemental Master.<br>
 (Ack)... I am in pain... But I cannot die yet. I could not die peacefully until I see with my own two eyes the birth of the successor. You, the young leaf, I have a request. Please make the enzyme and bring it to me, so that my life may last just a while longer.<br>
