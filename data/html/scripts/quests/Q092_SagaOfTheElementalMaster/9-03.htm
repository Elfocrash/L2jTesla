<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>The Tablet of Vision becomes overwhelmed by bright lights. While you are holding the stone to work on it, you start to acquire a new sense of knowledge as you hear the voices of thousands reading scriptures in the background. You now realize the truth of the world and yet understand nothing. There is a vision of a beautiful blonde woman and a knight with black armor. The vision disappears. The location of the next commune is gradually becoming clear...A vision appears...The sixth Tablet of Vision hidden in the wilds. Standing before the sixth tablet is a beast with red eyes and sharp fangs!...and the Resonance Amulet, held in the mouth of the beast, emits a dim light.<br>In an instant, the images disappear and then the stone goes completely dark.</body></html>
