The solution is in this gem! This is what we call the stone of vision. If you use the power contained in it, you can understand the Gods' characters written on the Tablet of Vision. Also, if you grasp this gem, you will know intuitively the location where this tablet is hidden.<br>
I don't know who the hell made this thing, but one thing is clear - someone or some being is helping the dark elves learn the knowledge that is forbidden by God. As the person who is exploring the true power of the magic, we cannot miss this good opportunity.<br>
Now, I will give you this stone of vision I've used in the past. If you go in the direction indicated by the stone of vision, you will find the first Tablet of Vision. Please become the Elemental Master who will succeed me. I will pray that the wind of Shaiha leads you the right way.</body></html>
