I feel the presence of many spirits around you. Your bond with the unicorns, who have been associated with our tribe since ancient times, tells me that you're the one who can stop the discord that has tarnished nature's harmony.<br>
Head Summoner Galatea told me about you. In fact, I've been watching you closely since you passed the Test of the Summoner! I've seen your wisdom grow by leaps and bounds!<br>
Your time has come. An <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Master</font> will soon be born who will become the ultimate summoner in charge of the the beasts the belong to the goddess Eva, with holy poets and songs... Will you be the one? Are you up to the challenge?<br>
