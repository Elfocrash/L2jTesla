Pets can be very useful creatures.<br>
If you are unable to carry items due to space or weight restrictions, you can transfer items to your pet and they will carry them for you. Bear in mind that they cannot run errands.<br>
If your pet is killed it may be resurrected within <font color="LEVEL">20 minutes</font>. If it is not revived within the time limit, the pet will be gone forever.<br>
