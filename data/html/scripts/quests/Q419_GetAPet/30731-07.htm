Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh yes, you are an Orc, aren't you? In that case, you must go to your hometown and stop the slaughter of innocent animals there. Can you handle that?<br>
If you go to the Immortal Plateau you will find <font color="LEVEL">the kasha spider, kasha fang spiders and kasha blade spiders</font>. They are the worst offenders in that area. They are killing off the animals at an unsustainable rate.<br>
You must go and kill them and bring back proof of your victory! Now, if everything is clear, be off!
