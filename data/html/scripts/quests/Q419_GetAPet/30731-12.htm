<html><body>Pet Manager Martin:<br>
Your next task is to learn the basics about the pets. Without basic knowledge, you'll never be able to care for a pet. You may not know it, but I am the branch office manager of the Animal Lovers Association. We take care of everything concerning pets, and screen all candidates to make sure they qualify to raise a pet. Only qualified people will receive pets.<br>
The members of the Animal Lovers Association are spread out all over the world. It is, in fact, a large organization. <font color="LEVEL">I want you to meet the members of our Animal Lovers Association, and come back after you have gained knowledge about pets from them.</font> Do you understand? I shall give you the list of people that you need to meet. Come back to me once you have met all the members on the list.<br>
But be aware, just meeting them is not enough. You must listen to what they say, and learn about pets from them. Once you've done that, I shall test you myself. Our members will give you plenty of helpful information. Just listen carefully to them and you will do fine on my test.
