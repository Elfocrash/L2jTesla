Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh, yes, you are a Dark Elf, aren't you? In that case, you must go to your hometown and stop the slaughter of the animals there. Do you think you can handle this task?<br>
In the Dark Elven Forest, you will find <font color="LEVEL">the lesser dark horror, the dark horror and the prowler</font>. They are the worst offenders in the Dark Elven Forest. They are killing and consuming the animals at an unsustainable rate.<br>
You must kill them to stop this injustice! Please bring us proof of your victory. Now, if everything is clear, be off!
