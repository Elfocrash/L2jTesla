Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh yes, you are an Elf, aren't you? In that case, you must go to your hometown and stop the slaughter of the animals there. Can you handle that?<br>
In the Elven Forest you will find <font color="LEVEL">the crimson spider, the hook spider and the pincer spider</font>. These are the worst offenders. If they are allowed to continue many species will surely become extinct. You must kill them and stop this slaughter of innocents. When you are done bring proof of you victory. Now, if everything is clear, be off!
