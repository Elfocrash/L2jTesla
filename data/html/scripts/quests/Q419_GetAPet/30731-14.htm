No, sorry...You failed the test! You made a worthy effort but it wasn't enough. No pet for you.<br>
Oh, I hate to see you look so sad, I suppose I can give you one more chance. You can take the test again, but it won't be the same, of course... <font color="LEVEL">First you must meet with the animal lovers association members again and take some lessons from them.</font> Then you can take the test again.
