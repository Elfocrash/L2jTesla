We should talk about the wolf that you will be raising...<br>
I must first explain their reproductive cycle. A wolf's fertility period is normally <font color="LEVEL">1-2 months</font>, and the pregnancy lasts for approximately <font color="LEVEL">60-62 days</font>. Normally, they will give birth to 3-6 cubs, but can produce up to 10 cubs at a time. They create a very safe home for their young ones. Places such as between rocks, under cliffs, and caves.<br>
Wolves are more omnivirous than assumed. A full grown wolf can easily devour a calf or goat whole. Wolves also eat the flesh of dead animals, wild pheasants, and even berries. They can go without food for 5-6 days, but cannot live long without water.
