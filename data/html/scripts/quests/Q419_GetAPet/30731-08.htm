Let's see...There are so many of them...<br>
Oh, yes, you are a Dwarf, aren't you? In that case, you must go to your hometown and stop the slaughter of innocent animals there. Do you think you can handle this task?<br>
In the Spine Mountains Mining Zone you will find <font color="LEVEL">the hunter tarantula and plunder tarantula</font>. They are the worst offenders in the that area. They are killing and devouring animals every day. Soon there will be no animals left!<br>
You must kill these monsters and bring proof of your victory. Now, if everything is clear, be off!
