Let's see...There are so many!<br>
You are from Talking Island, am I correct? In that case, you must go to your hometown and stop the slaughter of innocent animals there. Can you handle that?<br>
Talking Island is infested with <font color="LEVEL">giant spiders, talon spiders and blade spiders</font>. They are the worst offenders. These monsters are devouring innocent animals every day, so much so that their populations are rapidly dwindling.<br>
You must kill these monsters and bring proof of your victory. Now, if everything is clear, be off!
