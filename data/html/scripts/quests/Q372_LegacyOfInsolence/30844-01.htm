<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
Recently, some fearless people have gone into the Tower of Insolence. They are frantically searching for ancient, secret treasure. We of the Gray Pillar Guild cannot be left out of what's going on in there. That tower was built by dwarves! We can't allow outsiders to plunder it! We already have a team in there, are you interested? Well, come to think of it, you don't look very experienced... I wouldn't want to have to haul your cold corpse out of there...<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 59 and above.)
