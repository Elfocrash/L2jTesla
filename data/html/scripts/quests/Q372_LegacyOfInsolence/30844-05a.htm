<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
Are you OK? How did you forget so quickly? OK, once more. Listen carefully. Bring to me the blueprints of the Tower of Insolence. There are 13 of them.<br>
Take them from <font color="LEVEL">corrupt sages, erin ediunces, Hallate's inspectors, Platinum tribe overlords, Platinum guardian prefects and messenger angels</font>. You can keep anything else you find on them. All I want are the blueprints... If you're able to get and bring back the blueprints for all 13 floors, then, I will give you a very rare and precious recipe or ingredient.<br>
Is that clear? Now, please, get going.<br>
