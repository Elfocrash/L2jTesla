Amazing! Please give it to me. Hmm... I knew it! Baium wasn't the last emperor of the Elmoreden empire! Although his reign was brief, Printes, Baium's son, ruled the empire. He eventually went missing somewhere in the Goddard region...<br>
Thank you for bringing me the book! I find it so fascinating! Here is your reward. If you find any other books like this, please bring them to me!
