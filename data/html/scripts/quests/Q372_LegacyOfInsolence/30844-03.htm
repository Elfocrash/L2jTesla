Marvelous! In the middle section of the Tower of Insolence you will find monsters such as <font color="LEVEL">corrupt sages, erin ediunces, Hallate's inspectors, Platinum tribe overlords, Platinum guardian prefects, and messenger angels</font>. It is they who are in possession of the blueprints of the tower. Please recover the blueprints and bring them to me. In return, I will give you a very rare and precious recipe or ingredient. What do you say? Interested?<br>
