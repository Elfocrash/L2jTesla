How did you know that I'm researching the history of the empire? I'm trying to convince everyone I'm just a pure and naive girl...<br>
History is my passion! My grandfather was also a researcher studying the history of the Elmoreden empire. I'm currently researching the genealogy of the royal family.<br>
If you come across any books dealing with that subject, please bring them to me. You wouldn't refuse an innocent and naive girl's request, would you? Well... I wouldn't ask you to do it for free... If bring me all the records of genealogy of the empire, I'll give you a few valuable relics my grandfather left me.
