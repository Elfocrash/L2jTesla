There's a rumor that you've been collecting old scrolls at the Tower of Insolence... Have you come across a scroll of ancient epic, written by a troubadour from the ancient era? If you have such an item, it could be of great value. Artistic value is quite subjective. It may look like someone's doodling to you, but to the trained eye, it could prove to be more valuable than precious stones. If you find such an epic, please bring it to me! I'll pay you very well for it.
