Bolter sent you, eh? Lessee here...oh, he ordered some <font color="LEVEL">Boomboom Powder</font> a few days ago. Last time he used too much while trying to blast a new mine entrance and singed his beard! Hopefully he'll be more careful with this batch.<br>
Here you go: 1 sack of Boomboom Powder. Please don't drop it!
