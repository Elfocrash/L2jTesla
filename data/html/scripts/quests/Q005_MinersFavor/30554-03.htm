<html><body>Miner Bolter:<br>
Here's a list of the supplies we need. Let's see...<br>
Ah! First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from <font color="LEVEL">Trader Shari</font>.<br>
Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from <font color="LEVEL">Trader Garita</font>.<br>
After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from<font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Chief Reed</font>.<br>
Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Brunon</font>.<br>
Brunon has become very absent-minded, so take these -- just in case you need to shock him back to reality!
