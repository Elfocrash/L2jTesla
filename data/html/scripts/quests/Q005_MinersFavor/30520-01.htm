The item Bolter entrusted to me...? Ah! You mean the Dion-brewed <font color="LEVEL">Redstone Beer</font> he gave me last week! Where is it...here! It goes down very smooth, I can tell you that. Just the thing to wash away the dust of the road. Just thinking about it makes me thirsty...<br>
Well, well...uh, I really must return to my account book. You'd best deliver it to Bolter before something...happens...to that cool, tasty beer...
