<html><body>Miner Bolter:<br>
I'm a member of the Gray Pillar Guild, which controls this Strip Mine. Those hard-working Dwarves over there are all my guild brothers.<br>
Frankly, we prefer it out here, living among the rock and rubble of the mine instead of some stuffy cottage back in the village. The only drawback is that we still have to send someone into the village every few days to get supplies. It was Fundal's turn to go, but he broke his leg in a mining accident this morning. Do you know anyone trustworthy enough to go in his place?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 2 and above.)
