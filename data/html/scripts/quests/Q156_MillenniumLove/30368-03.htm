<html><body>Lilith:<br>
Before the beginning of the war against the devil Beleth, Theon and I made a promise to stay on Talking Island and teach the Humans the use of magic for harmony and preservation, so that there would never be another Beleth. If Theon is still alive, I am sure he will come to this island to honor our promise. It has been a thousand years since we parted, but I still hold on to the belief that someday he will come to this island, and I continue to wait to this day. Seasons change, and change again, and as the years pass by, my heart is filled with despair, but I have not abandoned hope yet.<br>
But a few days ago, I heard some glad news while dining with Sir Windawood. He says that he saw an Elven warrior in the village of <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> fitting the description of Theon... My heart was racing when I heard that...<br>
If you are planning to travel to the mainland, could you go to the village of Gludin for me and check for news regarding Theon?<br>
