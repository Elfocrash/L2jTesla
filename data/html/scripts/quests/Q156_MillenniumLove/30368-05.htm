I see that you have not left the island yet. But there is no need to hurry. For us Elves, "waiting" may mean tens, even hundreds of years.<br>
When you go to Gludio, please stop by the harbor village called <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> and ask the whereabouts of an Elven warrior named Theon. Please!
