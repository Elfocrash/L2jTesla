<html><body>Lilith:<br>
I see ... Theon ... has gone back already to the arms of Eva. It's not that I did not think of such a thing ... but it is all right. There is no need to comfort me.<br>
I had hoped to see his face just once ... I just wanted to go near him and quietly call out his name ... Fate is such a cruel thing ... Making us meet and fall in love ... And to spend such a long time yearning for each other ... and finally separate us with death ...<br>
This ... This is Theon's diary? Thank you. I would like to be alone today and spend some time in quiet, reading this diary. I will never forget your good intentions. This is a small token of my gratitude. Please accept.
