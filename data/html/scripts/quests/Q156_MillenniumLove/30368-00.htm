Thank you. But I must tell you something in advance. Please don't feel insulted, I only say it out of concern for you. It may be a little dangerous for you to travel to the Gludio mainland. It is a land made barren during the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangerous place, where all kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocent people. It may be even more dangerous now than a thousand years ago when Beleth existed. Of course, the lord of Gludio is conducting reconstruction projects, but the southern regions of Gludio are still barren plains.<br>
I have waited for more than a thousand years now, and it makes no difference to me to wait a few more years. There is no need to hurry. Whenever you are ready to leave for the Gludio mainland, come and seek me.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 15 and above.)
