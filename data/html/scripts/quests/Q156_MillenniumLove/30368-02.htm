<html><body>Lilith:<br>
Long ago I was a high level Spellsinger, and my lover <font color="LEVEL">Theon</font> was the best of the Temple Knights. One year in late fall, we began our love for each other, and while the buds on the trees grew and withered, then fell, and while this was repeated time and time again, our love grew even stronger. During these happy times, we were sent as envoys to the Human kingdom of Elmoreden to relay the will of the tetrarch.<br>
At that time, the devil <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> continued to widen his territory with his evil powers in pursuit of world domination, and because of this, many people fell into distress and the world nearly came to an end. Eventually the Mystics of the Ivory Tower waged war against Beleth in order to stop him, and Theon and I aided the Human army in fighting against Beleth. But in the final battle, when the Ivory Tower Mystics used forbidden magic to trap Beleth, I was severely wounded. And when I woke up many months later, I learned that I had lost the lover whom I had loved more than my life.<br>
My friends told me that Theon had met a noble death, fighting against the undead armies to the very end in order to buy time for our allies to retreat. But the body was never found, and I could not accept the fact that he was dead. I would like to believe that he is alive somewhere under this sky. From then on, I have stayed on this island for a thousand years to honor the <font color="LEVEL">promise</font> that Theon and I made long ago. I await the day when I can meet him again and return to our homeland together...<br>
