The Gludio mainland is a very dangerous place, and it worries me a little even as I am asking you this favor. It is a land made barren during the war against the devil Beleth, and a dangerous place, where all kinds of monsters threaten the lives of innocent people. Of course, the lord of Gludio is conducting reconstruction projects, but the southern regions of Gludio are still barren plains.<br>
I have waited for more than a thousand years now, and it makes no difference to me to wait a few more years. There is no need to hurry. When you decide to leave this island and go to the Gludio mainland by ship, please go to the harbor village called <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> and ask about an Elven warrior named Theon. And if ... this may be a small hope ... but if you meet Theon, please give him this <font color="LEVEL">letter</font>.
