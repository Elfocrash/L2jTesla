<html><body>Master Ellenia:<br>
Have you ever seen the race called the ratmen? We Elves call that lowly race "plague bringers." Originally no disease existed anywhere in the Elven Forest. But when the dirty ratmen entered our forest, they spread disease and plague, and we learned for the first time what it means to become ill and weak.<br>
Their nest has recently been uncovered, and a group will be sent soon to eradicate them. We will surely drive the plague bringers out of our forest. But this is business between Elves and ratmen. I don't think the one of a foreign race, like yourself, should be involved.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven character.)
