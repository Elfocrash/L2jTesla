<html><body>Master Ellenia:<br>
Then I shall draw up our Contract. What you must do is to kill the <font color="LEVEL">ratmen</font> and bring back their <font color="LEVEL">fangs</font> as proof. I will compensate you for as many as you bring back. Furthermore, if you kill their leader <font color="LEVEL">Varool Foulclaw</font> and bring back one of his fangs as proof, I will give you a great reward.<br>
We should not leave any of them alive, those dirty villains that have polluted the Elven Forest with disease and collaborated with the dark race! In Eva's name, may they all receive the stillness of the grave! According to the sentinels, the ratmen nest is in the abandoned <font color="LEVEL">Elven Underground Fortress</font>. If you do not know the way to the Elven Underground Fortress, ask Sentinel Starden. May the divine protection of Eva be with you.
