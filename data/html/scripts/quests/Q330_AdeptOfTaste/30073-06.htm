You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar. And ten bottles of royal jelly to boot! I will be able to make a delicious golden honey from this!<br>
Here you go. A honey so sweet that slumbering grizzly bears will awaken with a snap! Put some of this honey on freshly baked bread and eat it with a nice glass of warm milk ... Ahh ... Just the thought of that makes my mouth water!
