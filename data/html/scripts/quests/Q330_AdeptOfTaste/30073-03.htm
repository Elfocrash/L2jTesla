You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar. I can make a honey from this. But if I add Royal Jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, Golden Honey. For this, I need <font color="LEVEL">ten bottles</font> of Royal Jelly. It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.<br>
What do you think? Should I just create a honey from the nectar you have brought me? Or will you try to gather more Royal Jelly?<br>
