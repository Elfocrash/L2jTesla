So you haven't been able to gather all the moss yet. As I told you, you must hunt giant ants like the <font color="LEVEL">gray ant</font> and <font color="LEVEL">giant crimson ant</font> to obtain swamp moss. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">twenty bundles of moss</font> and I will prepare them for cooking.<br>
Swamp moss is usually green, but if you want a truly luxurious dish, you must invest the time and look for <font color="LEVEL">brown moss</font>.
