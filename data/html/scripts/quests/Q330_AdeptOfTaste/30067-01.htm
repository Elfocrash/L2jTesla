So you are the one helping Jonas. He told me that he needs Swamp Moss for his cooking. Swamp Moss is very refreshing and many people enjoy eating it, but it is very hard to find. It only grows in cold and damp places deep in the Cruma Swamp.<br>
But I know an easier way of getting this Swamp Moss. It may be a little dangerous, but you don't need to wander the swamp for many days to find the moss. Giant ants like the <font color="LEVEL">Gray Ant</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giant Crimson Ant</font> collect the moss to line their nests. You will be able to easily obtain the moss by hunting these ants.<br>
Take this insect diagram along with you for guidance. It shows where the moss is stored when the ant collects and swallows it.<br>
Bring me <font color="LEVEL">20 bundles of moss</font> and I will prepare them for cooking. Swamp Moss is usually green, but very rarely one may come across brown moss. This <font color="LEVEL">brown moss</font> has a fuller flavor and is more nutritious, and fetches a high price on the market. If you want a more luxurious dish, it would be better to invest some time and find brown moss.
