I learned the arts of cooking from Master Croker, and have developed my skills by myself for the last ten years. Though I do not know how to wield a sword or anything about magic, I am sure that I know more about cooking than anyone else.<br>
But I am frustrated, as I have yet to receive recognition for my talents. I would like to prove my skills and become famous as the top chef of the kingdom. And I want to return to my family with pride.<br>
That is why I have come to Dion. Every month, chefs from all over the kingdom come together to compete in a contest. The judge is the Elven Magister Mirien, also known as the <font color="LEVEL">Food Critic</font> for her food judging abilities and discerning palette. Cooks that receive acknowledgement from Mirien receive a reward from the lord himself.<br>
I entered a chicken dish at the last contest, but failed. But that is because the weather was bad and the meat was not good! It had nothing to do with my cooking methods! I plan to enter the contest being held next month. I am currently thinking up a new dish that I can enter. I would appreciate it if you could help me with gathering the ingredients later.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 24 and above.)
