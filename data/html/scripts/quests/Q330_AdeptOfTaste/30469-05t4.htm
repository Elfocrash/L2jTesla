I see you have brought all five ingredients that I asked you for. Thank you for your trouble.<br>
I see you have found excellent ingredients. These ingredients will make a magnificent dish. Shall we begin cooking, then?<br>
First, I slice the monster eye meat into appropriate pieces and marinate it in drevian wine ... Next, we go into preparations for the steak sauce ... Mix Mandragora Essence and vinegar and add thinly sliced onions ...<br>
There! It is complete. I have finished the setting and packed it, so please hurry and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font>. And please tell me how she evaluates my cooking!
