I see you have brought all the ingredients that I asked you. Thank you for your trouble.<br>
Some ingredients could be better ... but this will make quite a satisfactory dish indeed. I will proceed immediately with the preparations.<br>
First, I cut the monster eye meat into small pieces and marinate it in drevian wine ... Next, we go into preparations for the steak sauce ... Mandragora extract combined with vinegar, then thinly sliced onions ...<br>
And so! It is complete. I have finished the setting and packed it, so hurry up and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font>. And please tell me how she evaluated my cooking after she tasted it.
