I see you have brought all five ingredients that I asked you. Thank you for your trouble. However ...<br>
I am sorry to say this, but some of the ingredients you brought could have been better. You could have found better ingredients if you had taken a little more time ... But we must not tarry any further, so I will go right into the preparations.<br>
First, to slice the monster eye meat into appropriate pieces and marinate it in drevian wine ... Next, we go into preparations for the steak sauce ... Mix Mandragora Essence and vinegar and add thinly sliced onions ...<br>
There! It is complete. I have finished the setting and packed it, so please hurry and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font>. And please tell me how she evaluates my cooking!
