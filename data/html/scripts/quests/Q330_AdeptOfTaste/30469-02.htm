I learned the arts of cooking from Master Croker, and have continued to develop my skills over the last ten years. Though I do not know how to wield a sword or cast spells, I am sure that I know more about cooking than anyone else.<br>
But I am frustrated, as I have yet to receive recognition for my talents. I would like to prove my skills and become famous as the top chef of the kingdom. And I want to return to my family with pride.<br>
That is why I have come to Dion. Every month, chefs from all over the kingdom come together to compete in a contest. The judge is the Elf <font color="LEVEL">Magister Mirien</font>, also known as the <font color="LEVEL">Food Critic</font> for her food-judging abilities and discerning palette. Cooks that receive acknowledgement from Mirien receive a reward from the lord himself.<br>
I entered a chicken dish at the last contest, but failed. But that was because the weather was bad and the meat was not good! It has nothing to do with my cooking methods! I plan to enter the contest being held next month.<br>
I failed the last contest, but I want to try again with this month's cooking contest. I have thought of a marvelous dish, but I am worried about the ingredients. A dish depends on fresh, quality ingredients, but the ingredients needed for this dish are all hard to find.<br>
Please help me gather these ingredients. If I do well in the contest and receive the lord's award, I will give you half of it.<br>
