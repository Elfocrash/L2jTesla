Yes. Please continue in your efforts. If you can get twenty bundles of brown moss, I will prepare them well for you. Jonas' dish will become even more astounding.<br>
As I explained before, in order to gather the swamp moss, you must go to the Cruma Marshes and hunt gray or giant crimson ants. Brown swamp moss is a very rare, so it will not be easy to find it.
