You have found all thirty Monster Eye Carcasses! Thank you for your efforts. Now I will begin to prepare the meat.<br>
The monster eye has many pores that emit poisons on its body. Therefore it is very dangerous if you do not trim the meat properly. If you cut off all the dangerous sections, you are not left with much meat. That is why you need thirty carcasses to obtain meat for one person.<br>
There! All finished. I have packed it well, so take it to your chef friend just as I've packed it. Monster eye meat steak...I am truly curious as to its taste. Tell your friend that I wish him luck.
