I see you have returned. I have already heard the news. So Mirien was not all that pleased? I had anticipated as much, but ... I'm sorry to hear it. Next time, please find me better ingredients so I can try again.<br>
Here, take this. It is not much, but it is a token of my thanks for helping me. Thank you so much for your trouble. If my dish had received high points, then I would have given you more with the lord's prize money ... I am truly sorry.
