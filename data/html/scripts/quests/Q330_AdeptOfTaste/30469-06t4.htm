I see you have returned. I have already heard the news. It is not easy for the Food Critic Mirien to say that something is "magnificent!" At last, I will be recognized as a cook! Now I can be the man of my family. This is all thanks to your help.<br>
It seems that the lord has already been informed of the results. He has sent me some prize money. As promised, I will give a portion to you. Thank you so much for your trouble. You have gone through so much trouble to find good ingredients.<br>
Ah, and as a gift, I will give you a memo with the secrets of my cooking.<br>
I suppose you have your own dreams as well? Be patient and persevere. Then someday you will fulfill that dream.
