I understand. I will go ahead and prepare the twenty bundles of green moss you have brought me It would be best if we could provide brown moss for Jonas ... But since we are short on time, we have no other choice. You won't be needing the rest, so I'll take them.<br>
Here, all done. I've rinsed off all the dirt and cut off any inedible portions. Please deliver this to Jonas. And tell him I will be praying for his success.
