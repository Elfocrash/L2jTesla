I see you have returned. I have already heard the news. So the Food Critic Mirien said that it was the "best dish!" Finally, I am acknowledged for my skills as a cook! Do you think this is finally the reward of all the shame and contempt I received from my family and friends? This is all thanks to your help.<br>
I plan to cultivate my skills further and someday go to the king's palace of Aden and apply for the position of court cook. Then I will go meet my family in style.<br>
The lord has sent a letter of congratulation and prize money. He has requested that I prepare the food that will be served at the banquet that takes place at the castle next month. I think I will be busy with that for the time being. As promised, I will give a portion of the prize to you.<br>
Ah, and as a gift, I will give you a memo with the secrets of my cooking.<br>
I suppose you have your own dreams as well? Be patient and persevere. Then someday you will surely fulfill that dream.
