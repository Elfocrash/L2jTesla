<html><body>Guard Jacob:<br>
Honey? Hmmm? How did you know? Actually, my family has been in the beekeeping business for many generations. Though I've become a guard, I still haven't forgotten the skills of making a good honey.<br>
To make premium honey, you must collect <font color="LEVEL">nectar</font> from the giant bees that live here in Dion. Nectar is the honey water that the bees store in their honey sacs after sucking it out from flowers with their tongues. Bring twenty bottles of this, and I will make a honey from it.<br>
To gather the nectar, you must hunt the giant bee called the <font color="LEVEL">bloody bee</font>. You could also collect nectar from the <font color="LEVEL">stinger wasp</font> that lives in the swamps, but it is such a large and ferocious creature that you must be very careful when taking it on. And since you probably don't know the structure of a bee's honey sac very well, refer to this insect diagram while hunting.<br>
Oh, and if you are lucky, you may be able to obtain something called <font color="LEVEL">Royal Jelly</font> from worker bees that are less than a week old. It is a white liquid with a sour smell, but it is a rare ingredient with much nutrition and flavor. If you can bring me <font color="LEVEL">ten bottles of Royal Jelly</font> as well, I can make an even more flavorful and Golden Honey.
