I see you have returned. I have already heard the news. It is not easy to receive a favorable review from the Food Critic Mirien. However, it seems that she was not greatly pleased. What a pity ... Next time, please find me better ingredients so I can try again.<br>
It seems that the lord has already been informed of the results. Although I did not receive high points, the lord sent some prize money. As promised, I will give a portion to you. Thank you so much for your trouble. I hope we can work together again next time.
