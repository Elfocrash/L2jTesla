Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking last month. He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas. His cooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is ... inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br>
Oh! It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ...?<br>
It is monster eye meat! How did he think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea. However ... The meat is tough and the sauce seems too mild. The salad goes well with the meat, but lacks freshness. Is it because of the dressing? It was a good attempt, but has some weaknesses.<br>
I will give you this letter with my review. Please give it to <font color="LEVEL">Jonas</font>. And tell him that I look forward to finer cuisine in the future.
