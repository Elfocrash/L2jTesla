Thank you. The dish I am planning to make uses monster eye meat, which is usually used by Mystics in their research. I want to cook the monster eye meat as a steak, the way Gracian nobility like it. For that, I will need five ingredients.<br>
I need <font color="LEVEL">Mandragora Essence</font> to make a sauce for the steak. You can get this from <font color="LEVEL">Trader Sonia.</font><br>
The salad that will accompany the steak will be made from <font color="LEVEL">marsh moss,</font> one of Dion's delicacies. This moss only grows in the Cruma Marshlands, and its refreshing taste is truly a treat. They say that you can find the moss if you ask <font color="LEVEL">Priestess Glyvka.</font><br>
I plan to make the salad dressing with mustard and <font color="LEVEL">honey.</font> You can obtain the finest honey if you ask <font color="LEVEL">Guard Jacob</font> a favor.<br>
I will also make a <font color="LEVEL">potato dish</font> to accompany the steak. They say that the potatoes grown in Dion are the best in the kingdom. You can obtain them from <font color="LEVEL">Grocer Pano in Floran Village.</font><br>
The main dish, the steak, will be made from <font color="LEVEL">monster eye meat,</font> like I mentioned before. It's best that you go to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rollant</font> to find the monster eye meat.<br>
Please gather these five ingredients for me. I have written them down on this list, so don't forget. A dish's flavor depends on how much care was given in gathering the ingredients. Your job is indeed an important one. Thank you.
