To make the honey, I need enough nectar to fill twenty bottles.<br>
You can obtain the nectar by hunting giant bees like the <font color="LEVEL">bloody bee</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">stinger wasp.</font> But the stinger wasps are very large and ferocious, so be careful.<br>
If you are lucky, you may be able to obtain something called <font color="LEVEL">Royal Jelly</font> from worker bees are yet a week. If I add Royal Jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, Golden Honey. But for that I need <font color="LEVEL">10 bottles of Royal Jelly.</font> It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.
