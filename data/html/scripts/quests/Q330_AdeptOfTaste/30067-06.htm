Oh my! You've brought me twenty bundles of brown moss. I will prepare them immediately. You won't be needing the rest, so I'll take them.<br>
Jonas will be able to create a wonderful dish from this brown moss. He's had so many failures in the past ... I hope he can finally receive acknowledgement for his cooking skills.<br>
Here, all done. I've rinsed off all the dirt and cut off any inedible portions. Here, smell it. Such a lovely, fresh smell, isn't it? Please deliver this to Jonas as soon as possible. And tell him I'll be praying for his success.
