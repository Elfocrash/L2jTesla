Was it made by Jonas? I tasted his cooking last month. He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas. His cooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is ... inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br>
Oh! It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ...?<br>
It is monster eye meat! How did he think to cook it into a steak? It is a unique idea. Ahh ... Delicious! Truly delicious! The tenderness of the meat and the sauce are first rate. Did he use Mandragora Essence? The fresh moss salad goes well with the meat. The honey mustard dressing is also very good. Excellent!<br>
This steak is by far the finest I have tasted since I have come out into the Human world! With these skills, I believe he has a great chance to become a court cook of the King's Castle of Aden. I will give Jonas the highest marks. Please give him this review. And tell him that I anticipate more of his fine cuisine in the future.
