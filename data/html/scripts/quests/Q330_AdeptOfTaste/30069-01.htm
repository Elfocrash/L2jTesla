That you want to use monster eye meat, one of the eight ingredients of magical studies, in cooking ... What a unique idea. I am becoming curious myself as to what the result will be.<br>
Very well. I will assist you in finding monster eye meat. If you hunt the monster eye and bring back the carcass, I will prepare it for you. To make monster eye meat for one person, you need <font color="LEVEL">thirty carcasses.</font><br>
The monster eye meat eaten by magicians when they prepare spells for psychic seeing and detection is usually obtained from <font color="LEVEL">monster eye searchers</font> and <font color="LEVEL">monster eye gazers.</font> Compared to other monster eye meat, which is very tough and bitter, the meat of these two monster eyes is tender and sweet. I think they will be appropriate to use as cooking ingredients.<br>
Take this book. I have marked the sections on the monster eye's body that have the most flesh. Keep it in mind when you hunt monster eyes.
