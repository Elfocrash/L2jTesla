<html><body>Grocer Pano:<br>
You haven't forgotten our Contract, have you? If you kill the <font color="LEVEL">hobgoblins</font> and bring back <font color="LEVEL">thirty Hobgoblin Amulets</font>, I will give you a sack of Dionian Potatoes. Use your sword to get rid of the hobgoblins that trouble Dion's farmers, so they are not able to swagger around any more.
