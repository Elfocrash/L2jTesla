Ah! You are the one that needed monster eye meat, right? Did you say you were going to use it in cooking?<br>
If you hunt <font color="LEVEL">monster eye searchers</font> and <font color="LEVEL">monster eye gazers</font> and bring their carcasses, I will prepare them for you. To obtain monster eye meat for one person, you must bring back at least <font color="LEVEL">thirty carcasses.</font>
