Is this Jonas' cooking? I tasted his cooking last month. He definitely has talent, but still lacks in some areas. His cooking is flawless, but his selection of ingredients is ... inappropriate, should I say? I wonder what this dish will be like.<br>
Oh! It's a steak! Shall I have a taste ...?<br>
It is monster eye meat! How did he think to cook it into a steak? What a unique idea. It is truly delicious! The sauce is excellent. Did he use Mandragora Essence? The fresh salad goes well with the meat. Magnificent!<br>
I will give you this letter where I wrote my review. Please give it to <font color="LEVEL">Jonas</font>. And tell him that I look forward to finer cuisine in the future.
