 Sagittarius's bow was stolen?<br>
 A few days ago someone was asking about The Bow.<br>
What? You want me to tell you about him for free?<br>
You want me to starve?<br>
 Hahaha...<br>
Well, I don't want to get any this time.<br>
 Instead, bring me an Ice Crystal Gemstone. Gemcutter Gedrik at the blacksmith shop in Goddard Castle can make the best Ice Crystal Gemstone.<br>
 Town. Once I have the gemstone, that promotion will be mine!</body></html>
