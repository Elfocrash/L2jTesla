 I've met the thief you mentioned.<br>
Don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't have anything to do with a thief like him!<br>
 He asked me to relay a message.<br>
He said, "Take this to the stone tablet south of the Tower of Insolence. You'll find me there."<br>
 You'd better watch out for this thief! I tried to trick him out of The Bow and I almost got killed! He's very tough!</body></html>
