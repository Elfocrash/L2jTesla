<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
You feel a strange, disconnected force enter your body.<br>
You begin to see visions. You see a landscape, I see a male Human. His entire body is engulfed by a dark aura that reminds you of the Pilgrim of Darkness.<br>
It's located on the road from Goddard Castle Town to the Ketra Orc Outpost.<br>
You feel the Tablet of Vision weakening.</body></html>
