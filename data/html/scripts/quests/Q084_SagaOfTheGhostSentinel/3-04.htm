 I didn't say that it was going to be easy. Like I said, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos do not easily trust strangers. To gain their trust, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Ketra's Messenger Wahkan of the Ketra Orcs</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk of the Varka Silenos</font>, and carry out the duty that they ask you to do. You seemed desperate to catch the person at any cost. Could I have misjudged you?</body></html>
