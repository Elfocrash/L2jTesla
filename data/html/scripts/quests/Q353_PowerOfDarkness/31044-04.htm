Wonderful! You can get the stone from the <font color="LEVEL">Malruk Succubus and Malruk Succubus Turens</font> that have been attacking those who pass by Dragon Valley. They belong to the race of darkness, and so they are not at all easy to deal with... Be very careful...<br>
I will reward you handsomely for your efforts.
