<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
I don't know if you've noticed, but the Mother Tree in the middle of the village has been slowly withering. The progress of the blight is so slow that it is hard to notice unless one possesses high magic powers. We do not wish to worry our brothers, and only a few of us know this secret. None of our ancestors' records show any incident of the Mother Tree withering. I cannot shake the dread that something is terribly wrong.<br>
As a result of my research, I discovered that the Mother Tree is withering because the water is full of contaminants that dry up the tree's roots. It is my guess that someone is polluting the water source of the river that flows into the village.<br>
But I cannot guess who that someone is. That someone would dare to pollute our life source, our water, in this chaotic time of war against the Misty Mountain orcs ... This cannot be left alone, it must be dealt with. The sentinels cannot be spared, as they must defend the village, and all of our Rangers have been sent to the woods in preparation for our battle with the orcs. You must go to the water source and find out the reason behind the pollution.<br>
