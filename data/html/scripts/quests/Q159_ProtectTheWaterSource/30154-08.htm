Well done. This will be enough to research the purification magic. As soon as the magic is complete, I will travel under the protection of the sentinels to the water source and perform the purification spell, and eradicate any plague zombies that may yet remain.<br>
My young kinsman, you have performed a great deed for our sacred Mother Tree Glade and for the Elven race. I will give you this as a tribute to your brave deed. It may not seem like much, but it will come in handy one day, so keep it well.<br>
May the splendor of mithril forever shine on the forest and lake!
