 ... journey of the pilgrimage? Are you saying there is someone who still does that now? How surprising...! But, you can't leave for the journey of the pilgrimage now. I can't give you the blessing.<br>
Originally, I'm supposed to give back the stone of blessing to the one that is taking the journey, but I can't give it back to you now.<br>
