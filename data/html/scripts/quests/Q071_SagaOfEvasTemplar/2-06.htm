Please wait. After I heat the Pure Ice and extract a drop, I can restore the stone of blessing.<br>
Now it contains the power of the goddess Eva. Find the first stone tablet south of the Tower of Insolence to begin your pilgrimage. While holding this stone, examine the tablet. The stone will take care of the rest.<br>
You're now a pilgrim of the goddess! May your path always be blessed.</body></html>
