The card that you took out is: <font color="LEVEL">%card2pic%</font>. The cards on the table are:<br>
<table border="0" border color="white" width="230" height="60">
<tr><td width="80" height="20" align="center">[Wilbert]</td><td width="150" height="20" align="center">[ %name% ]</td></tr>
<tr><td width="80" height="30" align="center">%card1pic%</td><td width="150" height="30" align="center">%card2pic%</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
So that's how you play the game. Pretty simple, eh? If you want to join a real game, let me know.<br>
