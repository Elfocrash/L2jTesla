<html><body>Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>
I drew <font color="LEVEL">%card2pic%</font>. The cards on the table are:<br>
<table border="0" border color="white" width="230" height="60">
<tr><td width="80" height="20" align="center">[Wilbert]</td><td width="150" height="20" align="center">[ %name% ]</td></tr>
<tr><td width="80" height="30" align="center">%card2pic%</td><td width="150" height="30" align="center">%card1pic%</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
What luck! Looks like I win. Still, it was a pretty exciting practice run, eh? If you want to play again, feel free to challenge me.<br>
