Ha ha! Think you have what it takes to be a winner? Yes? How about the two of us play a round or two? Tell you what, we can even practice a little first if you prefer. Of course, even a practice run isn't free -- after all, why play at all if there isn't something at stake? But I'll make the stakes low, so learning won't cost you much. Let's say... 1 <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Bead</font>. And if you win, I'll give you 800 adena! Can't beat that, my friend.<br>
Once you're ready to play for real, just hand over the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> and let me know! So what'll it be?<br>
