You haven't brought enough! As I said, open the bellies of the <font color="LEVEL">Kookaburra, Bandersnatch and Grendel</font> in the Garden of Wild Beasts. Sometimes their entrails contain <font color="LEVEL">Vacualite ore</font>. This is probably due to their strange diet... Bring me <font color="LEVEL">50 pieces</font> of Vacualite ore and I'll make you a Vacualite.
