Open the bellies of the <font color="LEVEL">Kookaburra, Bandersnatch and Grendel</font> in the Garden of Wild Beasts. Occasionally their entrails contain <font color="LEVEL">Vacualite ore</font>. It's probably due to their bizarre diet! Bring <font color="LEVEL">50 pieces</font> of Vacualite ore to me and I'll make a Vacualite for you.
