All right, now find the Icicle Emperor Bumbalump, or whatever you want to call him, and put out this food and wait.<br>
He loves to eat, and won't be able to resist such a scrumptious meal from a world-class chef!<br>
You must hurry! Kill that filthy creature and bring me his meat!<br>
One more thing... He's quite a messy eater, and sometimes the table gets broken. If that happens, wait until he fixes the table.
