You don't have 1000 relics yet? Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">monsters in the Imperial Tomb</font>, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying! Collect <font color="LEVEL">1000 </font> relics and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon.<br>
Ah, I see that you have the <font color="LEVEL">sepulcher pass</font>! Ask the <font color="LEVEL">nameless ghost near the Four Sepulchers</font>, he'll tell you what it's for.<br>
