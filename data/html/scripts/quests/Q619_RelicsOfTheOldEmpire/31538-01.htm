<html><body>Ghost of Adventurer:<br>
I came here in search of treasure to reverse my losses... And was killed before I even laid eyes on any! It's so unfair! I must get some treasure! Of course, they say that all the good treasure has already been stolen by graverobbers!<br>
Hmmm... I remember overhearing some gossip that a group of aristocrats were slaugtered at this sepulcher by evil creatures. I don't mean any disrespect, but if you hunt the evil creatures, you might recover some accessories or jewelry carried by the aristocrats! If you find any would you bring them to me?<br>
