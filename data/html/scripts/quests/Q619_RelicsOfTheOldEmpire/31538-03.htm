<html><body>Ghost of Adventurer:<br>
Please, do this for me! Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">monsters in the Imperial Tomb</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">1000</font> relics and I'll give you some scraps of paper I've collected. Many people really like my scraps of paper. I'm not sure, but I think they're some sort of weapon recipes...<br>
While you're doing this, you may find a <font color="LEVEL">sepulcher pass</font> that was carried by one of the aristocrats. Ask the nameless ghost near the Four Sepulchers, he will tell you what it's for.
