<html><body>Ghost of Adventurer:<br>
I came here in search of treasure to reverse my losses... And was killed before I even laid eyes on any! It's so unfair! I must get some treasure! Of course, they say that all the good treasure has already been stolen by graverobbers!<br>
Hmmm... I remember overhearing some gossip that a group of aristocrats were slaugtered at this sepulcher by evil creatures. Perhaps the treasure from those slain aristocrats might still be there... But this is far too dangerous of a mission for you to take on...<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 74 and above.)
