<html><body>Elias:<br>
I am Elias, one of the teachers from the Einhovant's School of Wizardry. My students and I went to the forest to the north of the island on a field trip recently, but some of my students have fallen ill with a <font color="LEVEL">strange fever</font>. It has been more than a week since they became ill, but we have yet to find a treatment. I am going crazy with worry that my students may die.<br>
Thankfully, the Priest Yohanes has created a medicine, but he is running short on ingredients. Will you not go and gather the <font color="LEVEL">necessary ingredients</font> for my dying students? Your aid is urgently needed. We need the <font color="LEVEL">Poison Sac of the giant spider</font>, and I am asking you because I trust that someone of your abilities can easily manage this task.<br>
