<html><body>Priest Yohanes:<br>
Elias has sent you, I presume. I will hurry and make the <font color="LEVEL">medicine</font> from the Poison Sacs you have brought me. Anyhow, Elias must be devastated at the turn of events that has happened to his students. But I think that Elias is largely responsible... taking the students to such a dangerous place and all. We Priests always request the protection of the guards when venturing outside the village, but they say that Elias refused the help of the guards, relying only on his magic. So his students pay for his folly... tsk tsk...<br>
Here, the medicine is finished. Take this and hurry back to <font color="LEVEL">Elias.</font> I'd like to see the students from the magic school run through the streets again. I pray that the blessings of Einhasad be with them. With this medicine and the powers of Einhasad, I am sure that the students will recover soon. May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.
