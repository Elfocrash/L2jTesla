I can't thank you enough for your help. The <font color="LEVEL">giant spiders</font> abound in the northern parts of the island, so hunt them and bring back their Poison Sacs.<br>
Once you have obtained the Poison Sacs, go to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Yohanes</font>. He will create a fever medicine from the Poison Sacs. Bring the medicine back to me.<br>
If one of my students should die, how will I ever face their parents? I just want to run far, far away. I implore you, please find those Poison Sacs. My students are dying!
