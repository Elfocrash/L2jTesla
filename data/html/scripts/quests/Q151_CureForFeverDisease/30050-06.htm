So this is the fever medicine. Ahh ... I am deeply grateful to you. Because you have so willingly helped others, we can save the lives of my students. May the angels bless you. I must hurry and send this medicine off to the school.<br>
But first ... Please accept this. This is a token of appreciation for having saved my students.
