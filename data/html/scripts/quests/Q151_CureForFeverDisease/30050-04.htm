You haven't left yet? Hurry and fetch the Poison Sacs. My students are dying, and it pains my heart to see those youngsters in feverish hallucinations.<br>
Go to the northern end of Talking Island to hunt the <font color="LEVEL">giant spiders</font> and obtain their Poison Sacs. Take the Poison Sacs to Priest Yohanes, and he will make a fever medicine for you. Bring the medicine back to me. I beg you to help, my dear friend!
