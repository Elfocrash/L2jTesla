I'm sure you know this, but our Aden Kingdom was at war with Gracia until recently. As a result of the wars, trade with Gracia is still banned to this day. That is such a shame for businesses like me... particularly since there is a large profit to be made from importing metals in high demand, like adamantite... eh? You don't know what adamantite is? Hmmm... I can't tell you right now, but if you are interested, I will explain it to you later.<br>
