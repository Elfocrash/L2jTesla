Good, then let me first tell you what <font color="LEVEL">adamantite</font> is.<br>
Adamantite is a very important metal for making weapons. Weapons and armor crafted from refined adamantite ore metal are of high quality. Most other weapons can't even compare. But this adamantite is not found in Aden, and has to be imported from the Kardif regions of Gracia. But since the trade ban was announced, it has been difficult to find adamantite anywhere in the Aden Kingdom. However, because I had established a partnership with a few Gracian traders long ago, I have been able to bring adamantite ore into this island away from the eyes of the governor. Well, strictly speaking, you can call it smuggling.<br>
Usually, we land the smuggling ship on the remote southern shores of Talking Island, then load the materials onto a small boat and travel upstream to unload them on the shores of the lake near Einhovant's School of Magic. But an unforeseen accident a few days ago have put me in a bit of a dilemma. So I'd like to seek your help with that problem... What about it, will you help?<br>
