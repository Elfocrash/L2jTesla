Oh, you have recovered them. Good job! I must send them off immediately today, on the next trade boat to Giran. This is all thanks to you. Here, the reward that I have promised. I hope you won't talk to anyone else about this. It won't be good if this reaches the ears of the guards. I trust that you will take care of things even if I stop right here. Well, may the blessings of the land be with you!
