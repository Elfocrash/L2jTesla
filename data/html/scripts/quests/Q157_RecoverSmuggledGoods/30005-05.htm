<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Wilford:<br>
Good, so we see eye to eye. Now listen carefully to what I tell you. Do you remember the day that the recent storms hit? That particular day was the day that my 'business partners' and I were to bring some goods in. Thankfully, the smuggler's ship landed safely on the southern shores of the island.<br>
Because I had to unload before sunrise, I attempted to move the goods to the unloading place, even if it meant overexerting myself. But while going upstream with the adamantite ore loaded on my lifeboat, the boat was upturned by the waters of the river that was swollen from the storm, and the ore was scattered all around the lake. My business partners and I spent all night walking around the lakeshore gathering the ore. But after we gathered together all the ore that we had collected, we were missing quite a large amount. As I found out later, <font color="LEVEL">giant toads</font> that live near the lake had swallowed the ore.<br>
So what I would like to ask you to do is walk around the shores of the lake adjacent to Einhovant's School of Wizardry, hunt the toads, and recover the <font color="LEVEL">adamantite ore</font> that they have swallowed. I have to send the goods to Giran, and I must send twenty at a time. When you have gathered <font color="LEVEL">twenty</font> of them, bring them to me. I will give you a generous reward for them. Now, go if you are ready.
