<html><body>Grand Magister Fairen:<br>
I realized, after suffering your awesome attack, that you'd actually become more powerful than any disciple I'd ever taught! I knew at that moment I didn't have to worry about you anymore, so I backed off!<br>
I realize I can't keep you in the nest forever. At some point I must let you go.<br>
Please forgive me! I was wrong. Your diligence is inspiring, but you're not ready to transfer to the Storm Screamer class yet. Come back when you've improved your skills!<br>
(Only characters of level 76 or above may transfer to the Storm Screamer class. Don't abandon the quest until your class transfer is complete.)</body></html>
