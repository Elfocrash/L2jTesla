Well, I suppose you have your mind made up, eh? Well, I won't try to stop you.<br>
But I'll give you one last piece of advice: the Tablet of Vision cannot be read with your eyes alone. You must use a <font color="LEVEL">Resonance Amulet</font> to truly comprehend its message. This is known as <font color="LEVEL">communing with the tablet</font>. At one time, the Resonance Amulet was very rare, but lately, it's been turning up everywhere! I think that dark forces are behind this!<br>
Now, go and speak with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Kamilen</font> in Goddard Castle Town. He'll tell you what to do next.<br>
Good luck! Pick up a copy of the guild bulletin on your way out!</body></html>
