<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
 Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. Images twist inside my mind until they finally slow down and I begin to see something familiar...<br>
 The pain lessens and I am able to make out the location of the Tablet. I see the next Tablet to find The background of the Tablet resembles <font color="LEVEL">the North of Border Outpost</font>. The Resonance Amulet cannot be far though I cannot discern its exact location... It looks like Haures whom I recognize from a picture is a book. I peer at it closer, but the visions fade. Everything returns to normal. I will go to <font color="LEVEL">the North of Border Outpost</font> where the Resonance Amulet is.</body></html>
