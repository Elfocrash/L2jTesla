<html><body>Maid Leikar:<br>
I asked <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Ferris in Aden Castle Town</font> to make a <font color="LEVEL">sewing kit</font> for me, and I asked <font color="LEVEL">Jeweler Ellie of Giran Castle Town</font> for some <font color="LEVEL">gemstones</font>. I also asked <font color="LEVEL">Radia of Giran Castle Town</font> to make me some <font color="LEVEL">fabric</font>. None of them has contacted me yet. Would you go see them and bring back the materials? Meanwhile, I'll take these cookies to the castle.
