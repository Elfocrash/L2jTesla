<html><body>Magic Trader Wesley:<br>
I buy ingredients from adventurers like you, create various reagents from them and then sell them to the Mystics of the Ivory Tower. Although a mere merchant, I am proud of my association with the Mystics.<br>
Many common ingredients such as Jade and Dragon's Tooth are readily available, as many adventurers bring them to me. But there are other ingredients that are much more rare. I need a new regular supplier of these ingredients... Would you like to be that person?<br>
