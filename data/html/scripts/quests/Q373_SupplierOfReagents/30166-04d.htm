Formulas explain which ingredients and the amounts you will need in order to create a particular reagent. All formulas explain how many ingredients and how many catalysts should be added.<br>
For example, in order to create Dracoplasm, ten units of Wyrm's Blood and one Blood Root should be mixed.<br>
I wrote down a list of the required reagents and mixing formulas on the <font color="LEVEL">memo</font> and attached it on the urn. Please refer to it often.<br>
Well, my dear new partner... I'll be counting on you.
