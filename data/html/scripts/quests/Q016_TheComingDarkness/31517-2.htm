Very well. Based on the trust we have for you, brother, I'll give you a mission. Use these five crystals of binding to break open the seals that have been placed throughout this region. Watch the altar carefully; you'll discover how to use these crystals. I'll wait here until you break all the seals and return.<br>
First, you must go to the altar near the entrance of the Valley of Saints. Your mission begins there. Good luck!
