Thank you. Your task is fairly simple. Collect <font color="LEVEL">fifty Wolf Claws</font> and bring them to me. You can acquire the claws by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">ashen wolves</font> or <font color="LEVEL">goblins</font> outside of the village. The lowest goblins have crude talismans made by stringing Wolf Claws.<br>
As a reward for helping me, I will give you one of the defense items from my store. I swear on the eye of Shilen which observes everything, that I will faithfully fulfill the terms of our Contract.<br>
Wonderful! I thank you in advance. There is not much time, so please hurry.
