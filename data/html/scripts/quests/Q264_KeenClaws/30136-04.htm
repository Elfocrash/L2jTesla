<html><body>Trader Payne:<br>
According to the Contract we have entered into, you must gather <font color="LEVEL">fifty Wolf Claws</font> and bring them to me. You can acquire the claws by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">ashen wolves</font> or <font color="LEVEL">goblins</font> outside of the village. The lowest goblins have crude talismans made by stringing Wolf Claws.<br>
Now hurry! There is not much time left.
