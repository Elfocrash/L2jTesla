<html><body>Trader Payne:<br>
The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by my hands. As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are made from steel or adamantium.<br>
But sometimes I get orders for custom-made arrows. For example, the Assassin Kiel Nighthawk has ordered a claw-shaped arrowhead made of Wolf Claws. He is away at the siege battle in Giran right now, but I am sure he will order arrowheads again when he returns. I'd like you to help me gather the Wolf Claws when that time comes.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 3 and above.)
