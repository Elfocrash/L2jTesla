Very good! Slaughter <font color="LEVEL">Last Lesser Giant Glaki</font> and bring me his Nucleus!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Last Lesser Giant Glaki and then bring his Nucleus to me.
