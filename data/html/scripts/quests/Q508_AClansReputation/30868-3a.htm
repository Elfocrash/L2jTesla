Too bad! I need you to slaughter <font color="LEVEL">Gargoyle Lord Tiphon</font> and bring me his Shard!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place and watch your Clan kill Gargoyle Lord Tiphon and then bring his Shard to me.<br>
