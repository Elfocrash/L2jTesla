I will give you the Red Fairy Dust if you bring <font color="LEVEL">10 skulls</font> each from the <font color="LEVEL">grandis, karull bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord, and the Leto Lizardman overlord</font>! Didn't you hear me swear on the jewel? Pixies always keep their promises! Would you like me to tell you once more where you can find them?!<br>
Grandis can be found in Death Pass.<br1>
Karul bugbears can be found in Hunters Valley.<br1>
Breka orc overlords are located in Breka's Stronghold.<br1>
And, Leto Lizardman overlords are usually found on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
