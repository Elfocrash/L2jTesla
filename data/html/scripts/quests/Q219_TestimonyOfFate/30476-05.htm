Legend says that the Remains of Alder rest here in this village, in the shrine of Einhasad. If we acquire the remains, we could summon the spirit of Alder and ask him where he hid his copy of the revelation.<br>
Recently brother Metheus contacted us and offered to hand over the remains. Go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Brother Metheus</font>. He is in <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad's shrine</font> in this village.
