Brother of darkness, you now know the truth of abyss. My congratulations on your newfound awakening. You have glimpsed the <font color="LEVEL">dark fate our tribe must endure</font> during the coming age of chaos. Do not be despondent, however! Your task now, like all of ours, is to concentrate on the mission before us.<br>
To that end, I now award you this<font color="LEVEL">Mark of Fate</font>. You will need it if you ever transfer to a higher class. I'm sure you will be much changed when next we meet; I sense a powerful destiny ahead of you. May Shilen's power shield you always.
