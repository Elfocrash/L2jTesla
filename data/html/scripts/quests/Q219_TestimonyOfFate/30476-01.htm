<html><body>Magister Kaira:<br>
Our task is to discover the hidden truths. The Dark Elves have the shortest history and are the fewest in number among the 5 races, but we understand the power of darkness better than anybody else. We fearlessly explore and manage the very thing that other tribes dread: the power of darkness, the ultimate secrets veiled under the black abyss... This is our strength.<br>
We believe that the more truth and hidden knowledge we uncover, the stronger we will become. If you wish to advance to a higher level, you must learn more knowledge and truth. Most important, you must accomplish your previous task and excel at the introductory level.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 37 and above.)
