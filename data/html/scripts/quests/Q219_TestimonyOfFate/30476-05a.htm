Alder's Ash lies in the Einhasad Temple here in town. If you can obtain it, you can use the exorcism ritual to call the Alder's spirit from Purgatory and ask where the Revelations are kept.<br>
Not long ago, Brother Metheus contacted us and said that he could give the Alder's Ash to us. Go meet with <font color="LEVEL">Brother Metheus</font>. You will find him in the local <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad Temple</font>.<br>
And take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
