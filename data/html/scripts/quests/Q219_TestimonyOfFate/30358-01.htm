Welcome home, young brother. It seems like only yesterday when you came here after you finished training in the shrine of Shilen. My, haven't you grown!<br>
This document you have found is known as 'Kaysha's Revelation'. It contains the truth about Shilen! It contains the truth of the goddess, long thought lost! That document is essential to our suvival in the Age of Chaos. It will be the key to the opening of a new era.<br>
Now it is time for your Initiation Ceremony. You shall share the experience and knowledge that you have acquired in the Human world, as well as absorbing the accumulated knowledge of the ancestors. Take this letter and amulet to <font color="LEVEL">Shaman Arkenia of the Dark Elves Initiation Altar</font>. She will help you complete the Initiation Ceremony of Shilen.
