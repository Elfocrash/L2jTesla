<html><body>Brother Metheus:<br>
Thank you so much! At last my sister's death will be avenged! Although I shall surely be damned for it, I intend to personally see the beast get what he gave to my beloved sister.<br>
Here is the <font color="LEVEL">skull of Alder</font> from the crypt of the temple as I promised. Take it.
