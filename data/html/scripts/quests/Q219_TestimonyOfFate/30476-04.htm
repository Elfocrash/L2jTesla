At last there is news of <font color="LEVEL">'Kaysha's Revelation'</font>, which was thought lost. While the Human religious reformation distorted many facts about the goddess Shilen, this revelation contains the truth about the goddess, written in the age of giants. If only we could recover it we would gain a better understanding of the goddess and the source of her power.<br>
No doubt the original scroll of the revelation has been destroyed, but a copy of the revelation has being handed down until this day. Have you heard about Hornius the Human scholar from the imperial era? It is said that he was murdered by believers of Einhasad while researching Kaysha's Revelation. It is rumored that one of his students made a copy of the revelation.<br>
The name of the pupil is Alder. He was once a monk assigned to the shrine. He saved himself from being burned at the stake by the Inquisition by swearing that he would convert to Einhasad. But according to the recently found memoirs of Alder, he was convinced that Kaysha's Revelation was an important historical document. He therefore secretly made a copy and hid it away. We must find it.<br>
