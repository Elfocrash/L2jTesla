<html><body>Magister Kaira:<br>
Our mission is to discover hidden facts and reveal forgotten truths. The Dark Elves have the shortest history and are the fewest in number among the 5 races, but we understand the power of darkness better than anybody else. We fearlessly explore and manage the very thing that other tribes dread: the power of darkness, the ultimate secrets veiled under the black abyss... This is our strength.<br>
The more we uncover the truth and reveal hidden knowledge, the stronger we will become. This is what we firmly believe. If you can discover the <font color="LEVEL">Forbidden Knowledge</font> and thereby enrich our spiritual heritage, you will be acknowledged for your contribution and be given the approval to advance to the higher rank of Warrior or Magician.<br>
