<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
I remember... I saw it in an Old Account Book... We Dwarves are very precise record keepers. It is recorded that when my predecessor first came here to the town's warehouse, a pale man in a priest gown left a scroll with him.<br>
It is the Steel Gate Guild's purpose to protect all deposited things completely, so we have kept the scroll safely secured for the last 200 years. Although your receipt is very old, there is no doubt that it was issued by our warehouse. One moment. I shall bring the deposited goods.<br>
Here you go! Some of the pages in this book are torn, but that was how it looked when it was deposited!
