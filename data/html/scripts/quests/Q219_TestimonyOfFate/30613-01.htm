<html><body>Alder's Spirit:<br>
This is a copy of Kaysha's Revelation, ancient religious scriptures that I transcribed at great risk to my life. I will safeguard it for future generations. Although it is dark elves who now seek its secrets, I find it rewarding that such an old truth is again known to the world.<br>
You may obtain a written copy of the revelation from Gludin's warehouse. First you must obtain a bill from my daughter '<font color="LEVEL">Roa</font>' who lives in this village. Go to her and say '<font color="LEVEL">The moon emits light though you hide it with your hand</font>.' She will then give you the bill.
