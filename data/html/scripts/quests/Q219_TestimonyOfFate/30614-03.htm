<html><body>Brother Metheus:<br>
Thank you so much. At last my sister can have a decent burial...<br>
If you could please help me with one more thing, I need you to bring me some <font color="LEVEL">'Belladonna'</font>. I have read that this poison can kill a bull with just one droplet! I intend to kill the Priest Criton who executed my sister with this same poison.<br>
Isn't it true that your race has some familiarity with poisons?<br>
Please fetch the Belladonna as soon as possible and I will give you the skull of Brother Alder.
