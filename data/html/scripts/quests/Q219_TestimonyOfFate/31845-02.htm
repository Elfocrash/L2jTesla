I know what you want! You have come for the bloody Fairy Dust! Do you think I would just give it to you for free?<br>
If you do me a favor, I will give you what you seek. So listen closely!<br>
Our queen is a collector of bones. She seems most happy when she is arranging the skulls of strange animals. I admit, she is a little eccentric, but she is my queen!<br>
I will give you the Red Fairy Dust if you bring <font color="LEVEL">10 skulls</font> each, from the <font color="LEVEL">grandis, karul bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord, Leto Lizardman overlord</font>! I swear on this jewel!<br>
Grandis can be found in Death Pass.<br1>
Karul bugbears can be found in Hunters Valley.<br1>
Breka orc overlords are located in Breka's Stronghold.<br1>
And, Leto Lizardman overlords can usually be found on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
