<html><body>Seer Tanapi:<br>
If you kill a kasha bear, you must cut open its abdomen and take out the <font color="LEVEL">kasha parasite</font>. The evil spirit kasha contaminates the gray bears through the parasites.<br>
But the true enemy to defeat is the <font color="LEVEL">kasha totem spirit</font>. They say that the evil kasha spirit takes the form of the gray bear. Based on my studies, <font color="LEVEL">if there are enough parasites, they will call forth the kasha totem spirit.</font> I don't know how many are needed though.<br>
If you kill the kasha totem spirit, the <font color="LEVEL">crystal of the kasha totem spirit</font> will appear. Bring it to me. It is something I desperately need for my studies. If you bring it to me, I will reward you in the name of the Hestui. Good luck.
