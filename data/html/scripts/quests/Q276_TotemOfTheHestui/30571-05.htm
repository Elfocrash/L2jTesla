You finally brought the crystal of the kasha totem spirit! Thank you.<br>
So I was right when I said the parasites were the key to calling forth the kasha totem spirit. Now I must study this crystal. I will make sure that we Hestuis do not forget your help. Here -- this is my small token of gratitude. Please accept it. It is a totem of our tribe.<br>
One day, when I discover kasha, the true source of evil, I will trust your courage and ask you another favor. Till then, my young Orc, may the protection of Pa'agrio be with you always.
