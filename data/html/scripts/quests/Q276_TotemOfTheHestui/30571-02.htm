Young Orc, have you seen an animal called the <font color="LEVEL">kasha bear</font>? It is a poor animal polluted by <font color="LEVEL">kasha</font>, the evil spirit of death and decomposition. The animals contaminated by evil spirits die slowly because of the curse. However, that is not the only problem. The curse is terrible because it can be spread to other animals nearby.<br>
I am the Chief of the Hestui. We Hestuis have consecrated the gray bears and served them since ancient times. However, as gray bears recently became contaminated by the evil spirit kasha, the status of our tribe has been trampled to the ground, and not one day passes when we can sleep in peace.<br>
There is only one way to purify the gray bears polluted by the evil spirit kasha. That is to kill them. It is a difficult quest, but it is also worth undertaking. What do you think?<br>
