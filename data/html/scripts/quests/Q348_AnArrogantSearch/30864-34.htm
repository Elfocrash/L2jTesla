Listen carefully. Soak the White Fabric in the blood of <font color="LEVEL">Platinum Tribe Shamans and Overlords</font> and wrap yourself in it. The Angelic Vortex will accept you.<br>
This money should cover your travel expenses, with a little something extra for your trouble... I'm sorry that it can't be more.<br>
Once you pass through the vortex you should go immediately to the emperor. There will be no need for you to return here.<br>
You'll find the Tower of Insolence is much more dangerous than you've anticipated. You may not survive...<br>
Stop sniveling! If you're not up to it, then don't do it! Whatever you choose, good luck!
