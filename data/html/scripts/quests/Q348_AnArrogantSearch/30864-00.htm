So...you have managed to obtain the blood of the Platinum Tribe as I asked of you. You probably came back to hear the secret I promised to tell you, didn't you? If you remember, when you first started working for me, I had asked you if you were curious about that mysterious, swirling vortex over the tower of an ancient king.<br>
The secret of this vortex lies within the blood you have collected in this fabric! If you offer this blood to the vortex, you will be teleported behind the sealed door and you will be able to wake up the demented king Baium!<br>
Be careful, however, for he has gone completely mad and he is much too powerful to handle on your own! Be sure to go with a large group of allies should you ever wish to confront him! Of course, all your friends must also gain their entrance to his room... Good luck!
