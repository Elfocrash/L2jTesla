What business is that of yours? Have you been listening to gossip?<br>
I suppose you didn't believe Magister Hanellin when she said we were doing it to achieve world peace, eh? Very well, I shall tell you the truth. We Dark Elves seek to break open the seal in order to free our great Hierarch Mitraell from Baium. Earlier we sent an Abyss Walker to the Tower of Insolence and have not heard back from her.<br>
I'm afraid my personal feelings are getting in the way... Forget I said that...
