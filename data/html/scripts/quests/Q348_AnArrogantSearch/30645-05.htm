Wow, the Branch of the Saint! You must have paid a pretty penny for it! Does it call down lightning from the heavens? Trigger earthquakes or volcanoes?<br>
Humph, probably not.<br>
I guess it is as it appears, just an ugly, twisted stick. I hope you didn't make a special trip just to show it to me... Please take it, the blood and the book to Magister Hanellin. Your task is now complete. Next time, I'll give you an easier task. Hope to see you soon!
