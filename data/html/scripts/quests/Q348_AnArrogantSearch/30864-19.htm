The three sacred relics are contained in three separate arks and hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest across the Misty Mountains.<br>
We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in the Tower of Insolence and Baium.<br>
Please go and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Madam Claudia Athebaldt</font> in this village. She has been searching in this area for the ark for quite a while. I believe she has made some progress. I am fairly sure that she can be found strolling in the flower garden near Aden Castle... If you show her this letter, she will tell you where the ark is.
