The three sacred relics are contained in three separate arks and hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest across the Misty Mountains.<br>
We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in the Tower of Insolence and Baium. Not long ago the lover of a former chief created a huge ruckus in the tower...<br>
You must go to the Dark Elven Village and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Harne</font>. She recently sent word that she had located the ark in the Dark Elven Forest. There seemed to be something wrong, but she didn't go into it. I realize this is a long journey, but could you please go and check it out? Take this letter with you.
