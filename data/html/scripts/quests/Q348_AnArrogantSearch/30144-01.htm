Would you please give me the letter given to you by Magister Hanellin?<br>
Now you shall learn the results of our investigation. The ark can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">northern Marshland along the eastern edge of the Misty Mountains</font>. We do not yet know its specific location as they do in Aden and Giran, but as in those places we expect it to be protected by a <font color="LEVEL">Guardian of the Ark</font>. You must search for the ark where I said. If you find it, open it and retrieve the sacred relic contained within. I wish you all the best.<br>
