<html><body>Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
Were you sent by Magister Hanellin? I've been expecting you! Please, hurry and give me the items before someone sees you! She was going to send me three pieces of "the blood of the angel"...<br>
Is this it?! Ha! What a novel idea. I didn't know what to expect when she spoke of blood in terms of pieces... I've already paid her for this. Goodbye.
