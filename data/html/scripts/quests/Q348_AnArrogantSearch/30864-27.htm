Why are you still here? You must hurry! These sort of affairs inevitably attract troublemakers, we must be very careful. I have already sent some funding to <font color="LEVEL">Martien of Giran Castle</font>. If you don't report there immediately he will get angry and call the Contract due! I don't want to have to have him killed, but I will! Your life would be in danger as well, and I know you don't want that to happen!
