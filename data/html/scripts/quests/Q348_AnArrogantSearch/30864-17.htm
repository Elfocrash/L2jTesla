The relics are contained in three separate arks. The arks are hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest beyond the Misty Mountains. Here in Aden, <font color="LEVEL">Madam Claudia Athebaldt</font> is searching for the ark. In Giran, a fixer named <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font> of Giran Castle Town is searching for the ark, and in the Dark Elven Forest, <font color="LEVEL">Magister Harne</font> of the Dark Elven Village is searching for the ark. All three have reported that their searches are almost complete.<br>
Take these letters with you and find them. They will tell you what they have found so far. When you find the three arks, bring the relics back to me.<br>
