Ah, the Book of the Saint! So this is what was contained in the ark of Aden! You didn't need to bring it here, but I must admit it gives me satisfaction to finally see it in person. Magister Hanellin says that this book is complete garbage, a collection of totally worthless sacred songs... Have you read it? What do you think?<br>
Oh well, whatever, it is interesting to see something so old. We have really seen some antiquities lately, haven't we? There was the Blood of the Saint, the Branch of the Saint... and now this. If you take these three items to Magister Hanellin, she will know what to do.<br>
Farewell, may the next time we meet be under more pleasant circumstances...
