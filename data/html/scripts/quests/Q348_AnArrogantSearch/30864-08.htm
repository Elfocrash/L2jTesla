Good! Go and bring back two comrades with at least your level of skill. I'll tell you more about your mission upon your return. You don't all need to come back at the same time. Take these flowers, keep one for yourself and give the other two to your comrades. No, I'm not being romantic...<br>
Will you accept these flowers?
