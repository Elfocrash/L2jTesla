Very well, as you wish...<br>
Inside the Tower of Insolence you will find a teleportation device called the <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Vortex</font>. Oh, I see you are familiar with it. All the other devices in the tower have been activated, but this device, located on the top floor of the tower, has frustrated all attempts. It is known as the <font color="LEVEL">Angelic Vortex</font>.<br>
To activate it you must collect the <font color="LEVEL">relics of Saint Solina</font>. We have been searching for these relics for years, and have only recently discovered that they are contained in three separate arks, hidden in different locations. We have people currently looking for them.<br>
