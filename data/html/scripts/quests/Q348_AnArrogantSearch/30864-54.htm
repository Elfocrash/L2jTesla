Where are the other pieces? I distinctly remember asking you to bring me 10 pieces of White Fabric soaked in blood... You haven't thrown them away or given them to someone else, have you? Oh, well, nothing can be done about it now. Since you've done the work, I'll pay you, but I must say that I'm very disappointed... I thought you were trustworthy! Oh, well, live and learn. Goodbye.
