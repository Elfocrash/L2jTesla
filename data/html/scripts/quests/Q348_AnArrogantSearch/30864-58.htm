Well, I suppose I will have to tell you now, since you'll have to deliver the items to them anyway...<br>
First is <font color="LEVEL">Sir Gustaf Athebaldt of Oren Castle Town</font>. He is a black-hearted scoundrel, a distant relative of Claudia Athebaldt. He has been secretly supporting young warlords and expanding his power base.<br>
The second person is <font color="LEVEL">Hardin.</font> I need not say more, right? I hesitate to even call him human...<br>
And, finally, there is <font color="LEVEL">Iason Heine of Heine</font>... He dreams of one day taking over Innadril with the influence of his wealth. He is the biggest financier of this project. Take the blood-soaked cloths to these people. Your compensation will await your return.
