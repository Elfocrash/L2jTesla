We cannot delay this matter any further. Once I saw <font color="LEVEL">Shadow Fang, the Guardian of the Ark</font>, from a distance. He had a blank expression, devoid of any clear emotion or thought. He should be beaten to death, don't you think? I hope you can help me with this. I am at a loss! Please try harder this time, OK? Good luck!
