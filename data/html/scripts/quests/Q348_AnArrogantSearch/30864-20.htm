The three sacred relics are contained in three separate arks hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest across the Misty Mountains.<br>
We Dark Elves have a great natural interest in the Tower of Insolence and Baium.<br>
You must go to Giran Castle Town and meet with <font color="LEVEL">Martien</font>. At first glance he may appear a little slow, but show him some money and he comes to life. We hired him to search the area near Giran Castle... There is word that he is making progress. Take this letter to him and he should show you where the ark is.
