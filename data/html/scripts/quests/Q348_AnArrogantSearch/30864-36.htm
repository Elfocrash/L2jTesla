Oh, really? I thought this would be a good opportunity for you... I suppose I'll have to find someone else.<br>
If you want to meet the Emperor so badly, I have an idea... You could disguise yourself as a member of the Platinum Tribe! If you can trick the Angelic Vortex, you'll be able to enter the room of the Emperor! Soak the White Fabric I gave you in the blood of <font color="LEVEL">Platinum Tribe Shamans or Overlords</font> and wrap it around yourself. This is sure to deceive the Angelic Vortex!<br>
Here's your money. This should cover your travel expenses. I've put in a little extra for your trouble... I'm sorry it can't be more. After you see the Emperor, there will be no need for you to return here.<br>
You'll find the Tower of Insolence is a much more dangerous place than you've anticipated. I'm not certain that you'll survive...<br>
Stop sniveling! If you're not up to the task, then get out of here! Either way, I wish you luck!
