...The Book of the Saint, the Branch of the Saint and the Blood of the Saint! Finally, the three sacred relics, gathered in one place! Magnificent! Now I shall make it possible for you to stand before the demented king! In the mean time, I need you to run an easy errand for me. Please go to the grocery store and get me <font color="LEVEL">a bottle of Healing Potion</font> and <font color="LEVEL">five Antidotes</font>. While you are doing this I will finish getting things organized.
