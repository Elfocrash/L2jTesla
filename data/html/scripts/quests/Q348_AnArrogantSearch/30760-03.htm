Did Magister Hanellin send you? Good! I've been waiting for you! Quickly, before anybody sees us! Please give me the three units of angel's blood that I ordered!<br>
Isn't it original? Ah, blood soaked fabric, eh? Very ingenious! But this fabric couldn't possibly contain the three units of blood that I ordered...<br>
There must have been an error... How about going back to her and checking the quantity again?
