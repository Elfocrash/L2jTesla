You haven't even been to the Cave of Giants? Have you forgotten what I told you? You were to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Cave of Giants</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">a Lesser Giant Mage or a Lesser Giant Elder</font>. As proof, bring me the heart of a giant, also known as a powerstone. Don't keep me waiting!
