You've found all three materials. Well done! Now I can start my research to undo the 'spiritual chains.' We need further observation to see if the research will yield any results, but I believe that the seals placed on our patriarch will one day be broken. I will give you this as a token of my appreciation. Think of it as a just payment for working for our race.<br>
I am not alone in the research to break the seal. <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Kayla</font> is continuing her research in the region known as <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font>, to free the mental chains that bind the mind of our patriarch If you ever pass through that region, I suggest that you go and seek her. She may also need your help someday.<br>
May the shelter of the abyss be with you, 'til the day our Dark Elf race rules the destiny of the land.
