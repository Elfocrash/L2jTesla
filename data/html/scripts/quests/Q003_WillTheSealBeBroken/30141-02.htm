For hundreds of years I have devoted myself to researching magic that could break the seal placed on our Patriarch, Mitraell. But we are still uncertain of the exact magic that created the seal -- all we are certain of is that the magic used for the seal is entirely different from Human or Elven magic today, and that all our efforts towards breaking the seal have so far been futile.<br>
But recently, ancient magic scrolls containing secrets of the Dark Arts have been discovered in the northern lands of Pabel. Our Dark Elven brothers who have been sent there have succeeded in recovering those scrolls. After three days and nights of pouring over the scrolls, I have discovered a lead for the magic needed to break the seal.<br>
As you know, the seal is composed of three levels -- the physical seal, that restrains the body, the mental seal that restrains his mind, and the spiritual seal that restrains his soul. This time, I am attempting to break that first seal, the physical seal. But to perform the magic, I need many rare materials. I'd like to ask you to go and gather them. I'm sure you won't refuse?<br>
