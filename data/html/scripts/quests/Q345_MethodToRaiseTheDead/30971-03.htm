Oh, that is so kind of you! Thank you so very much! Science thanks you! I dream of the day when I and my colleagues can venture into the realm of Shilen... When that day comes the secrets of the universe will at last be unveiled! Just thinking about it makes my heart race!<br>
This isn't much, but please accept it as a token of my appreciation.
