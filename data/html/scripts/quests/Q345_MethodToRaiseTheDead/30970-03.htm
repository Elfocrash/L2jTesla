Not much, my friend... If I could, I would slice open the bellies of all the damned crokians I could find! If I didn't locate the treasure, as least I would have my revenge, no?<br>
In fact, I would really appreciate it if you would go to the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Whispers</font> just outside the village and kill <font color="LEVEL">crokians and crokian warriors</font>. Their corpses should yield the remains of my friends, and possibly more. Bring whatever you find back to me. Meanwhile, I will continue my investigation. If we find the treasure you will be greatly rewarded...
