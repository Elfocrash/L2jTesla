A voice emanates from the urn:<br>
"I understand... Dorothy was a lazy cow who did nothing but take the fruits of our labor... I'll tell you what she wants to know, but only because it's you... What she seeks is in the warehouse. That's all... Now, remember, be kind to others while you live. We shall meet again when you die."<br>
The urn falls silent...
