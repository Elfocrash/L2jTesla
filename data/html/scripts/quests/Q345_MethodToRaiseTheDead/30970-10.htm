Hey, don't try to pull that "little village maiden" crap with me! I worked hard to collect all those bones and if I need to I will go and collect them all again! Oh, wait, I just thought of something...<br>
Oh! Now I remember... One time Iason Heine's nephew offered a reward for finding a young maiden... His tastes are quite common for an aristocrat! If we play this right we could make a lot of money!<br>
You mustn't tell anyone about this. Here, take this as compensation. This information came from someone inside the Trade Guild... If you take this to the Blacksmith Guild, they will give you a good amount of money for it.<br>
Ah, come back if you continue to help your friends collect the ashes.
