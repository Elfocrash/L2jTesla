<html><body>Magister Dieter:<br>
Have you ever been to <font color="LEVEL">Devil's Isle</font>? It is the home of the devil Zaken. Of course he is not alone. There are all manner of nasty beasts there with him.<br>
Deep in the interior of the island you will find <font color="LEVEL">living dolls with silvery hair</font> that seems to be bathed in perpetual moonlight. Their hair intrigues me. I must get my hands on some of that magical stuff! The legendary power of just a few strands... Oh, well. Enough of my ramblings.<br>
Will you do it? Will you bring back some of their hair for me? You will be handsomely rewarded!<br>
