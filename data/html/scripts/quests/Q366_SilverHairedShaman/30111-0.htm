<html><body>Magister Dieter:<br>
Have you ever been to Devil's Isle? It is the home of the devil Zaken. Of course he is not alone. There are all manner of nasty beasts there with him.<br>
Deep in the interior of the island you will find living dolls with silvery hair that seems to be bathed in perpetual moonlight. Their hair intrigues me. I must get my hands on some of that magical stuff! But I am afraid you are not yet up to this task. Come back when you think you have become stronger.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 48 and above.)
