Ha Ha Ha, with this, you have passed the final test. Congratulations! Are you confused?<br>
I was testing your loyalty to see if you would keep a secret until the last moment. All that you have done until now was actually part of the test. The box that you brought is in fact just an empty box. I am sorry if I seemed like I was tricking you for a while, but this is how we Dwarves give our tests. "Always pursue profit" and "Never betray your colleague in a crisis" are two very different proverbs, and it is difficult to live up to them both.<br>
Since you have done both splendidly, I will give you the final certificate for passing the test of the Artisan. Now take this and go to <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Tapoy</font> to change profession to an Artisan. Of course, you know the required level is 20, right?<br>
If you understand, go on now and become an Artisan. From now on, we are colleagues!
