Really? So you've met such a kind-hearted Dwarf. Then I guess I have no choice.<br>
Ha ha ha, do you think that I would fall for a lie like that? But anyway, with this, you have passed the final test. Congratulations!<br>
Are you confused? My question was to test your loyalty and see if you would keep a secret until under pressure. All that you have done was actually part of the test. The box that you brought is just an empty box. I am sorry if I seemed like I was tricking you for a while, but this is how we Dwarves give our tests. "Always pursue profits" and "Never betray your colleague in a crisis" are two very different proverbs, and it is difficult to live up to them.<br>
Since you have done both splendidly, I will give you the final certificate for passing the test of the Artisan. Now take this and go to <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Tapoy</font> to change profession to an Artisan. Of course, you know the required level is 20, right?<br>
If you've understand, go on now and become an Artisan. From now on, we are colleagues!
