The first test is very easy; Though the Artisan's main task is making things, to be sure, he must also be able to find the materials needed for manufacture by himself, and not depend on others. The first test puts its focus on those basic skills. Oh, and by the way, take this ring while you are taking the test. Ok?<br>
Now I will give you the task. If you look around the Abandoned Coal Mines, you will come face to face with the nasty boogle ratman gang. They are the bad guys that trouble us Dwarves. Kill them and come back. But when you look at them, you'll see that they have nasty front teeth. The funny thing is that their front teeth are very useful materials. You know the famous motto of the Dwarves, right? "Whatever it is, there is nothing to throw out!"<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Catch boogle ratmen and boogle ratman leaders and bring their front teeth.</font> This is my task. See that you bring me <font color="LEVEL">ten boogle ratman teeth and two teeth of the boogle ratman leaders</font>. If you come up short, you fail! So make sure you have the right number.
