Good! So now listen carefully to what I have to say. First, take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Pinter in the town of Gludio</font>. If you give him this letter, he will give you something. Bring that back to me. What do you think? It's very easy, isn't it?<br>
If you've understood, go and get started!
