Are you sure? Could you do that?<br>
If so, I can give you one clue. This is a footprint that was discovered on the floor of the blacksmith shop on the night of the robbery. I think that it is probably the footprint of the thief. Looking at the footprint, there is no doubt that it is one of a <font color="LEVEL">Vuku Orc Fighter</font>. If you catch them and destroy them, I'm sure something will come out.<br>
Here, I will give you an impression of the footstep to use as a clue in catching the thief. By the way, the thing that was stolen was a large box. Thank you.
