<html><body>Blacksmith Silvera:<br>
I teach young Dwarves and manage the Test of the Artisan. All apprentice Dwarves arrive at an important turning point where they must decide their future occupations. Dwarves may choose the path of the Artisan or the Scavenger.<br>
Artisans, who I'm responsible for testing, create something from nothing. They have unbelievable talents and use the most modern techniques available in the world today for their creations. The Artisan is the middle step in the process of becoming a Warsmith. If you wish to become the greatest skilled craftsman in Aden, you must walk the path of the Artisan.<br>
