I think Obi probably told me this story... The six Dwarven Guilds are like the columns that support the house of Dwarves.<br>
Architecture, trade, iron manufacture, warehousing, collecting, craftmanship. Dwarves would cease to exist if even one of the six Guilds went missing.<br>
We Dwarves must put the good of our entire race above personal enrichment!<br>
We must never forget the bitter experiences that we've had in the past... We were enslaved by a tribe of savages... Only to see them destroyed by the very weapons they forced us to make for them!<br>
You passed the test! I'll give you this Pass Certificate and the Head Blacksmith will make you an Artisan.
