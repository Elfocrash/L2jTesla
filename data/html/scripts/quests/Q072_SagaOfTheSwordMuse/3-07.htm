 Ah, yes, the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>. It's owned by the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos.<br>
It holds a secret... the ability to communicate between tribes! Not only that, the fact that you have it is proof of your close friendship with them!<br>
 Although it's more than I can logically hope for, ultimately, it's my hope to communicate not only with animals but also with all other intelligent beings!<br>
 Bring it to me and I'll give you this Resonance Amulet. Which tribe will you get the stone from?<br>
