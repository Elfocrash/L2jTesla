Oh yeah, great song, buddy!<br>
You passed the test! You know, a while back, a lady wearing a blue dress appeared to me in a dream!<br>
She said that soon I'd be visited by a singer seeking a test. She told me I should do it.<br>
Do you know the test? It was respect! To pass the test, the person would do as I asked, no matter how rude my manner was. And, he would sing a song with a sincere heart...<br>
Here is the Resonance Amulet. Take it with you to the Tablet of Vision. The first tablet can be found in the south part of the Tower of Insolence.<br>
I'll pray that your song becomes popular! Oh, and thanks for the beer! Ha! Good luck!</body></html>
