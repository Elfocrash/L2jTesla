You're really going to sing? This should be hilarious!<br>
Honestly, sometimes I just don't get you Elves! We Dwarves never listen to music sober! It's like eating pancakes without syrup!<br>
Have you ever tasted beer? From the moment it hits your tongue, a cold tingle shoots through you like an electric current... straight to your brain! Bring me some of the legendary beer and I'll listen to you sing!<br>
What do you say? I'll bet Chef Donath in the Hot Springs area of Goddard can make the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Bitter Cold Beer</font>!<br>
If you get it from him, I'll listen to you sing!</body></html>
