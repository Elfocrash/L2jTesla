 Huh?<br>
Is that a beer?! Amazing! You really brought it! I thought you were just a weakling entertainer!<br>
I'm impressed! I guess if I live long enough, I'll see everything! You even brought snacks! You really take care of your customers, don't you?<br>
You passed the beer test with flying colors, but now comes the hard part!<br>
