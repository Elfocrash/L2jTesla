 What? The Resonance Amulet?<br>
Uh... As a matter of fact, yes, I have it! But I can't give it to you!<br>
Let me explain... For as long as I can remember, I've had but one dream! It was the same every night, but forgotten soon after waking. But recently, I remembered it!<br>
I dream of being able to communicate with all other intelligent beings! I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself... Basically, I just want everyone to understand each other... And the animals! I've always loved animals and want people to be able to talk with them!<br>
I believe that this Resonance Amulet will lead me there... But, if you really need it, I'll give it to you. Just trade me something of equal value for it.<br>
