<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Thoughts beyond understanding are seared into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br>
A vision appears of a man who believes that the thing everyone gave up on is possible.<br>
He hopes that one day everyone will understand each other! He's the Beast Herder Tunatun in the north of Rune Castle Town.</body></html>
