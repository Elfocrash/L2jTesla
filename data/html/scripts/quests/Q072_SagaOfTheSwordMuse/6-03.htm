<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br>
You see a vision of a male Elf, singing to thunderous applause!<br>
You once read about him in a book called <font color="LEVEL">"Critique of Biel's Song"</font>.<br>
Could he have the next Resonance Amulet?<br>
He's waiting at the next Tablet of Vision, in the northeast corner of the Ketra Orc Outpost!</body></html>
