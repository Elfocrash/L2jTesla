Excellent! This mission is critical to the war effort. I need you to go to the garrison of the Varka Silenos and kill their commander! He's known as Mos, and he's the best swordsman in the entire tribe! Although you're an excellent fighter, don't even think of taking him on alone! Gather your most reliable comrades together, and track down and kill Mos!<br>
The glorious flames of Pa'agrio will light your path forever!
