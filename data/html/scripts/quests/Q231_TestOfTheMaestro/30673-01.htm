<html><body>Researcher Lorain:<br>
We will have to discuss the research paper later! One of the team was poisoned by a monster in the dungeon! He managed to escape, but if he doesn't get an Antidote quickly he will surely die. Fortunately, all of the materials we need for the Antidote can be found around here... We must have help gathering them!<br>
You say you are an adventurer? We must have 10 Needles of Stinger Wasps, 10 units of Leech's Blood, and 10 Cobwebs of Swamp Spider... Can you find these things, please? We'll discuss the research paper after we have saved my colleague's life.
