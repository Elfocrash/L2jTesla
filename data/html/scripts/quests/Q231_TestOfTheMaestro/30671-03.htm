<html><body>Chief Croto:<br>
The altar of our ancestors is in the Cave of Trial. It is a huge cave in an area frequented by Orcs. Our army was last seen heading there. My nephew was among them. If you search the cave, you may find the remains of my nephew. If he was killed by monsters, please bring his belongings to me.
