<html><body>Filaur of the Gray Pillar:<br>
I don't mind writing you a letter of Recommendation, but first you must do something for me. In anticipation of next year's First Elder election our guild is planning to construct an amazing building. Our current skills are not up to the task. We require the technology of the ancient giants! If we can secure that our dreams will become reality.<br>
Certainly you know of the Cruma Tower? It is where the skills of the ancient giants are preserved. I have heard that a scout team from the Black Anvil Guild is there, too. They are led by a woman named Loraine or something like that... Go and obtain the technology from them. Do what you must.
