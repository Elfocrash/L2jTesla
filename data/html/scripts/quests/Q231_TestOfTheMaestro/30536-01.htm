<html><body>Elder Arin:<br>
The Black Anvil Guild represents the pinnacle of the Dwarven race. Thanks to our efforts, the lost skills of the ancient Giants have been rediscovered. As an elder, I will ensure that our skills progress even farther and faster. Our reputation among the other races will be unparalleled!<br>
Oh, did you say that you've come for a letter of recommendation? Very well -- I will assign you a task to determine whether you are indeed worthy of my recommendation.<br>
A portable teleportation device invented by our guild was stolen from us some time ago. We have determined that Master Toma is the culprit, but we cannot pursue him directly at this time. Your mission is to find Master Toma, determine the truth of the charges and return the device to us if he is indeed guilty.<br>
You will likely find him on the northern coast. When and if you return, we will talk further about the letter of recommendation...
