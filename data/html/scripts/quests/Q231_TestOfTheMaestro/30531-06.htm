<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
Let's see, yes they are all here. I am impressed! I'm sure the other Elders are preoccupied with the upcoming election. Did you learn much from them? Many people covet this position and would like it for themselves. Many also fail to realize the deep significance it holds for all of us Dwarves. I pray that you become a perceptive and far-sighted Warsmith.
