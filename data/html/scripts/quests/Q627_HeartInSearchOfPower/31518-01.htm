All I know so far is that the remains of saints are in a place called <font color="LEVEL">Enfeux</font>, which is sealed.<br>
I must make a seal from beads of obedience to unlock it. Beads of obedience control the thoughts of the creatures that guard the Valley of Saints. Bring me 300 of them. You can take them from the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Splendor, Flash of Splendor, Blade of Splendor, Wisdom of Splendor, Soul of Splendor, Victory of Splendor, Punishment of Splendor, Shout of Splendor, Signet of Splendor, Crown of Splendor and Wailing of Splendor</font>. I'm counting on you!
