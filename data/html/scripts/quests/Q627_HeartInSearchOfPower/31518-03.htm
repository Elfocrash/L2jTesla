<html><body>Mysterious Necromancer:<br>
The beads of obedience allowed me to create a Seal of Light. Could you possibly help me some more?<br>
Enfeux is in the deepest part of the Valley of Saints. It's marked on this Map. You can take it with you. To extract the remains of saints, you must insert this Seal of Light into the space to the right side of Enfeux. After activating it with the seal, you can take out the remains of saints. I hope you can bring back as many as possible, but remember, the Seal of Light can be used only once.
