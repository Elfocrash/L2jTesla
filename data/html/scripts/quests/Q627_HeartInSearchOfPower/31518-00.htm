<html><body> Mysterious Necromancer:<br>
You aren't a pilgrim, are you? Anyway, you've traveled a long way, haven't you? Could you help me with something?<br>
I'm trying to create a new type of chimera! I've tried all sorts of ingredients, including blood of vampire and muscle of Ogre!<br>
I've come here to find a new source for ingredients... But gathering ingredients isn't as easy as it seems! Right now I'm trying to find remains of saint!<br>
Why are you looking at me like that? You think we should just let them rot? Do you want to help me or what?<br>
