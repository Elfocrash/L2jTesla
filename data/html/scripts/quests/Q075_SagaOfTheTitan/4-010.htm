<html><body>Sake Dun Zu Hestui:<br>
No need to tell me, I'm the Orc who was expelled from the Hestui race and who helped conquer the Tower of Insolence! Luckily I'm relieved of those old burdens.<br>
I came here to defend my honor and test my strength. Take this stone, you need it more than I.<br>
I must give chase, see you again in battle someday!<br>
