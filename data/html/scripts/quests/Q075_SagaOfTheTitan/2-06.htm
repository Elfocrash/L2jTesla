Have you heard of the conquest of the Tower of Insolence? Did you know that there was an exile of the Hestui tribe among the conquerors?!<br>
That exile was capable of feats that even I, previously known as the strongest of all Orcs, could not do. He followed the path of self-discipline that my disciple abandoned!<br>
Now you know the depths of my shame. Take this stone and go south of the Tower of Insolence. You'll find a tablet there. Use the stone to commune with it.<br>
While you're at it, try and find out what happened to my disciple and what the exile of the Hestui tribe is up to.</body></html>
