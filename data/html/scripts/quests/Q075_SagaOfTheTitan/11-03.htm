Dear Warrior who is looking for the power of the ancient Orcs...!<br>
The power of this stone was created by the gods but stolen by devils! Find the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font> inside the Four Sepulchers at the Human Imperial Tomb!<br>
If entering is too difficult, go to the Shrine of the Loyal and fight Halisha's minions! He'll show up if you kill enough of them.<br>
Defeat him and get the Resonance Amulet!</body></html>
