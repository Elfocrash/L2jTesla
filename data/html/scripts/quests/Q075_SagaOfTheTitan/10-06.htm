Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. I can hear laughter as though coming from the back of my head.<br>
A man's voice states, "Another hero is born."<br>

The ancient Orc was with the flame of Pa'agrio. But the present Orc doesn't have it.<br>
The source of all the Flame Races is obviously fire. Fire can create a limitless power with its strong will. It is the power to be able to fight with a Giant. The will of the Flame Race that has a massive power as well as a Giant can not be defeated...!!<br>
