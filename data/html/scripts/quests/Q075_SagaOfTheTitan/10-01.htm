<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
You hear a disturbance as you approach the tablet.<br>
Sounds of rocks crashing, and the roar of a warrior resisting them!<br>
No fear of the most awesome opponent, eager for death in battle!<br>

Is that actually the tablet? The sound of swordplay is carried on the wind.<br>
