I'm very lucky! My job allows me to travel all around the continent.<br>
From the metropolis of Aden to the bustling streets of Giran, not to mention the magnificnet Heine, each place is wonderful in its own way! I've met many different kinds of people in my travels.<br>
Naturally, I returned to my home on Talking Island; it was the most comfortable place to me. I hope to travel again someday. I especially miss the night life in Giran!<br>
