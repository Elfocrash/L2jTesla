Oh, I hope I didnt give you the wrong idea! Traveling to Giran from here is very, very expensive! In fact, I'd say it's completely impossible for now.<br>
Hmm, well... You seem like a nice person... so I'll help you!<br>
The Einhasad Temple beside me is also known as the <font color="LEVEL">Twin Temple</font>. It's called that because twin brothers work there. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">Magister Baulro</font> there. He's always happy to meet students from Talking Island! In addition, be sure to be very polite and he may help you.<br>
...And don't tell anyone what I said!
