<html><body>Gatekeeper Roxxy:<br>
Oh, that's wonderful! Magister Baulo and Sir Windawood are very kind to do that for you.<br>
Now I can give you this Scroll of Escape. With it, you can use the gate of time and space to travel to Giran. Take heed, it only works <font color="LEVEL">once</font>! Use it wisely! I've placed it in your Quest Item Window for safekeeping. Don't forget! It works the same as any other Scroll of Escape.<br>
Also take this <font color="LEVEL">Traveler's Mark</font> that Sir Windawood asked for. If you ever want to come back to Talking Island after visiting Giran, show this mark to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci</font> at his shop and he'll help you. He's very strange, so be patient with him.<br>
May your journeys be productive!
