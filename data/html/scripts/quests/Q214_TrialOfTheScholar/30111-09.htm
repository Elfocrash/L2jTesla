The loss of the scriptures diminished my reasoning for a time...<br>
There were many outsiders around in those days... Mostly ill-trained hunters, watching for a chance for one shot at the village. They were laughable. However there were some outsiders who did not hunt and were always gone in the evenings...<br>
Yes! I remember them! There were 4 in the party, 2 humans, a Dwarf and a Dark Elf! I remember speaking with the Dark Elf once. He asked me something about my master, I can't really remember.<br>
The inn where they stayed is gone and the innkeeper died 2 years ago...<br>
I was good friends with the innkeeper's son, his name was <font color="LEVEL">Edroc</font>. The last I heard he was running a shop in <font color="LEVEL">the Hunters Village</font>. He might have some useful information. Go and see him, I will write a Letter of Introduction for you.
