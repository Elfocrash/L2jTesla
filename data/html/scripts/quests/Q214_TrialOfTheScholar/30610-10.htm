Such a helpless child, must I do everything for you? If you are totally flummoxed I shall give you a clue. You must find <font color="LEVEL">Dieter</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Magister's Guild in Giran</font>. He used to work for me... You should be able to get some advice from him. Don't waste time! Dieter will probably not want to talk to a greenhorn like you, take this mark and letter to introduce yourself!
