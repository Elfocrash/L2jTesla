<html><body>Magister Mirien:<br>
Now you must seek the highly respected Scholar Magicians and complete the tasks that they give you. Once you complete all the tasks, you will qualify for the trial.<br>
First you should see <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font>. He knows more than anyone about light's purifying power. He is also in charge of the spiritual purification of Dion territory. Previously he participated in the Elves' plan to purify the Sea of Spores.<br>
Take this mark to the High Priest and then come back to me.
