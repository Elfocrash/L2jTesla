You are looking for Chapter 4 of the sacred scripture? That is not something that I can hand over easily. Do you know what the scripture contains? Nothing less than all the knowledge of the world!<br>
This book may yet reveal the lost knowledge and science of the Giants, who have long since vanished from this world. Oh, the ultimate secrets of geometry... I lack the rest of chapters 1, 2 and 3, so many details are still unknown to me.<br>
