<html><body>Drunkard Triff:<br>
Hiccup~ Everyone but I was confronted by Des... something?! He is an unusually cruel and deceitful Magician. Damn! Burp~!<br>
Ever the hero, I gathered the scriptures and hid them away before he could find them. But <font color="LEVEL">the third one</font> was lost to the forces of evil, the dastardly <font color="LEVEL">Grandis</font>, a huge monster living in Giran. Hiccup~!<br>
But, now all is lost, hiccup~ all my friends are dead and I'm alone... sob...<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The second book</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the fourth book</font> are entrusted to <font color="LEVEL">the Warehouse Keeper Valkon at Giran</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the Blacksmith Poitan at Dion</font>. Hiccup~ Take my ring and meet them.<br>
Burp~I don't feel so good.
