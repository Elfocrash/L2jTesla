<font color="LEVEL">The Test of the Scholar</font> is one that all Wizards must pass. Only those who possess a passion for research and humility in learning will advance to the level of high magic and knowledge.<br>
I can tell that research is not your strong suit. Each person has their own way. Some will be Warriors, and others will search for enlightenment through spirituality. I pray that you find your own road and overcome all the obstacles that you confront along the way.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by Wizards or Elven Wizards.)
