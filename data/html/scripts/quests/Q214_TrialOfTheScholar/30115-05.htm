Let's see, <font color="LEVEL">Monster Eye Destroyer Skins, Shaman Necklaces, and Shackle Scalps</font>. You have brought me all that I have asked of you. I thank you on behalf of the Mystics Guild of Giran! With this evidence, I should be able to prove my suspicions and find Hardin's true purpose.<br>
As a token of my appreciation, I will give you my mark. You are more than qualified to receive this. Now return to <font color="LEVEL">Mirien</font>.
