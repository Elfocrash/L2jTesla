Good! You are a good fellow. Now listen to me carefully. I have heard of a very precious crystal, what was its name, yes, that's right, it is called <font color="LEVEL">the Purifying Crystal</font>. I have heard that only one person can make it.<br>
If you will bring me one of those, I shall gladly give you that Scriptures of Knowledge.
