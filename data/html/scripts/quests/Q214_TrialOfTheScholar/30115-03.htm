Good job! Now, take this mark and I will tell you of the monsters you must slay.<br>
First are the <font color="LEVEL">Monster Eye Destroyers</font>. Many of these creatures are found in the wasteland or on the Plains of Dion. You must bring me 5 Monster Eye Destroyer Skins.<br>
Next are the <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orc Shamans</font>. They can be easily found in Giran. Kill them and bring back 5 of their necklaces.<br>
Last of all are the <font color="LEVEL">Shackles</font>. I need 2 Shackle Scalps. They lurk in Dragon Valley and are quite dangerous. This is a perilous task, so please be careful. I'll write you a list to help you remember all of this.
