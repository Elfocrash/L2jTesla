For your last task you must see <font color="LEVEL">Elder Cronos</font>. He is the wisest prophet and the greatest scholar of all time. He is so old that he is mentioned in our history books, although no one actually knows how old he is or even his true name... It is said that he has been alive since the age of Elmoreden!<br>
He does have his detractors, however, with some going so far as to call him a swindler! However, I met him during my days of discipline and, in my opinion, he is the true prophet.<br>
He currently lives in seclusion in <font color="LEVEL">Hunters Village.</font> Occasionally he will venture out to join us in a trial in the hope of meeting some young scholars.<br>
Go and see Elder Cronos and take this mark with you. Accomplishing the task that he will give you is the final step of this trial.
