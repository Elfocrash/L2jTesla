This vision came to me from the key you gave me.<br>
"You were being watched by the thieves before you even stole the scripture. Because it was so long ago I was not able to distinguish much about them.<br>
There were 4 shadows. One of them was definitely a Dwarf, obvious from the short shadow. The other 3 were more difficult to distinguish. It was a moonless night.<br>
I saw them open the box and steal the scripture shortly after you left it there. They left hurriedly, in a northerly direction."<br>
I don't remember anything after this. I think there may be more secrets locked in my memory.<br>
