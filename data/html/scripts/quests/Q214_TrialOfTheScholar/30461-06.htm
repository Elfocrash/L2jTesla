Good job. I understand that High Priest Sylvain asked you to bring back the Crystal of Purity? I am glad to see that my concerns were unjustified. Congratulations!<br>
Now you should see <font color="LEVEL">Grand Magister Jurek</font>. He can be found at the <font color="LEVEL"> Wizard Guild of the Town of Giran</font>. He once was Chief Wizard of the Ivory Tower, but grew weary of the factional infighting within the Ivory Tower and quit.<br>
Now, take this mark and go see <font color="LEVEL">Jurek</font> in the Town of Giran. I wish you a safe journey.
