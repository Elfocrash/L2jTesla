Yes, I used to work for Master Cronos. Ha, he told you that, did he?<br>
I took that job because I wanted to learn magic. He mainly wanted an errand boy, but I was able to learn much from him eventually. Master Cronos was a nice man.<br>
He asked you to find the Scriptures of Knowledge? I shudder when I remember the last time I heard of that book. He flew into such a rage I thought he would kill me.<br>
