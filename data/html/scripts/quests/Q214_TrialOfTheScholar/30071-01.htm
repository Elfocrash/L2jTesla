<html><body>Captain Lucas:<br>
Maria's scroll... Ah yes, I have heard of its importance. We have looked everywhere and are still unable to find it. The thief must be very cunning.<br>
It is very unusual to have no clues in a whole month! Maybe we should consult a fortune-teller...<br>
Anyway, <font color="LEVEL">please tell Maria that I am terribly sorry</font>. I'll do my best to apprehend this thief as soon as possible.
