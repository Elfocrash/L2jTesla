I must have the scrolls in order to help you...<br>
Lucas's mention of the fortune-teller reminds me of something... I know an astrologer who is an old friend of my family. I haven't seen her since the peasant's uprising...<br>
Her name is <font color="LEVEL">Creta the Astrologer</font>. You should be able to find her in <font color="LEVEL">Floran Village</font>.<br>
Take her this letter. I think she may be able to help us... Please.
