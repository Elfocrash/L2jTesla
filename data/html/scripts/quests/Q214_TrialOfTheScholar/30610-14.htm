<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br>
Absolute geometry evolved from the beginning of time. It contains all truth in the universe. Mathematics, dynamics, architecture, astronomy, and navigation were all derived from the absolute geometry. He who truly understands absolute geometry can control the world.<br>
The secrets of absolute geometry are contained on <font color="LEVEL">Maphr's Tablet Fragment</font>, written in the ancient language of the Giants. Word has come that the Dwarves have been trying to obtain the tablet... I shudder to think of the consequences if this knowledge should fall into the hands of those greedy creatures!<br>
The Scriptures of Knowledge contains the secrets of absolute geometry written down in understandable language. Do you have any idea how dangerous this knowledge is? You must bring it back. Even though it was only a part that I transcribed... And with only 4 books the knowledge should be safe... We cannot be too careful...
