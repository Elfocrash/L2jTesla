What in blazes? I understood that there were only 4 volumes of the Scriptures of Knowledge... But now this! It says that there is one before the 1st and one after the 4th...! How could it be...? Without those two, we won't be able to understand the Scripture! What a blow! To find 4 volumes and then discover that it is not enough... Now I will never be able to decipher the texts...
