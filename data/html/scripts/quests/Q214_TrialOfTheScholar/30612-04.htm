Excellent. Here is what we'll need.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">10 pieces of Ghoul's Skin, 12 bottles of Medusa's Blood, 5 bottles of Fettered Soul's Ichor, and 5 Enhanced Gargoyle Nails</font>.<br>
You must get the Ghoul's Skin from the Ghoul himself. He can be found in the execution place of Dion.<br>
You must collect the Medusa's Blood from the medusas that you can find in the northern part of Giran.<br>
The Fettered Soul has been seen frequently in the Corridors of Death.<br>
Last, the Enhanced Gargoyle Nail... Among all the materials that you must find, this will be the most difficult. The Enhanced Gargoyles are much stronger than any of the other creatures. They may be found near the Ivory Tower of Oren.
