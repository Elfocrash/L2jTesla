Shut up and bring me <font color="LEVEL">five Honey Jars</font> at once!<br>
You're such an idiot! First you must kill the <font color="LEVEL">hunter bear</font>. The Honey Bear will appear afterwards. Conquer the Honey Bear and search him with the <font color="LEVEL">spoil</font>. Then you'll find the Honey Jars.<br>
You can find many hunter bears at the place where two divided coastlines meet, at the west entrance of the Abandoned Coal Mines. It's on the Map.
