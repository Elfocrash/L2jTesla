<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Raut:<br>
I'm sorry but you must do it.<br>
Do you know what that fraud Toma gave me when he said he would repay his debts? It is none other than the <font color="LEVEL">mark of the raider</font> that you want. Now do you know why you must listen to my request? Then let me tell you what you need to do.<br>
I have a nuisance of a nephew. One day the rascal was teased by his friends because he had bluffed that he could sell items to the monsters of <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</font>. And then the next day, he left with everything in the warehouse!<br>
Since he is the only child of my deceased brother, I have no choice but to find him. Please go and find him for me. Also, this is a scroll of return. Tell my nephew to use it so he can return immediately.<br>
Well then, good luck on your journey.
