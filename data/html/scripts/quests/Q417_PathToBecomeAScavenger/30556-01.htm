Who are you?<br>
Oh, a letter from Mion?<br>
Hmm... So you want to be a Scavenger?<br>
Do just as I say.<br>
This body yearns for something sweet. What do you think?<br>
My friend says that if you kill a <font color="LEVEL">hunter bear, </font>you can obtain an amazing honey. Please bring me just <font color="LEVEL">five Honey Jars</font>. Knock down the Honey Bear and rummage through with <font color="LEVEL">Spoil</font> and bring back the honey.<br>
First of all, find the <font color="LEVEL">hunter bear</font>. The Honey Bear appears sometimes after killing a hunter bear. Where is the hunter bear, you ask? Then listen well to what I have to say. If you go straight up toward the north at the west entrance of the Abandoned Coal Mines, there is a place where two divided coastlines meet. There are a lot of the bears there. Take a look at the Map for more details.
