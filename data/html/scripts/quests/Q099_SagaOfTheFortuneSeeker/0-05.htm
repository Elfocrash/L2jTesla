Well then, let's spit on the ground and shake hands! The trust between us has been established while Maphr has watched over us.<br>
Now I'll tell you what to do. The Benandanti cartel is searching for a legendary relic known as the Grail of Splendor. They would have found it by now if it were a real object, but it's not! It is actually the knowledge that reaches into the domain of the gods! It may be a part of the absolute geometry that elders of our guild have searched for since ancient times!<br>
There is nothing to be learned in books or scrolls about the grail. The gods wrote their secrets on six ancient stone tablets, and put them in secluded places, guarded by fearsome monsters! If you absorb the knowledge held in the six tablets, you'll attain the level of <font color="LEVEL">Fortune Seeker</font>, one who controls disasters and even the flow of destiny!<br>
 We must not let this valuable legacy slip into the hands of Benandantis! You must get the grail before they do!<br>
