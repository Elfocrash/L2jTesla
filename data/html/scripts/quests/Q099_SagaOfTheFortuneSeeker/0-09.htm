You've drunk from the Grail of Splendor and learned the ultimate absolute geometry! You've acheived the sacred knowledge! My only role is to confer an appropriate title on the person who has that knowledge. I hereby confer upon you the title of Fortune Seeker!<br>
Congratulations! I can't believe that a young Dwarf like you has become the Fortune Seeker of our time! Am I witnessing the beginning of a new destiny?<br>
 I expect great things from you in the future! Please work hard to become a positive role model for all the Dwarves! May Maphr's abundance be with you!</body></html>
