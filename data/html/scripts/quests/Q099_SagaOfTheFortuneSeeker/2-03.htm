Is this the document from Bavarin? It shows not only the location of the stone tablet, but how to read the questions written on the tablet. This is better than I expected. Excellent work, I underestimated you.<br>
Let's read it...<br>
Nobody can read the passage written on the six stone Tablets of Vision because the gods don't want us to learn the highest level of magic. They're afraid we would become arrogant and self-righteous, like Emperor Baium, Demon Beleth, or the giants did when they made war against them.<br>
They broke the tablet, where the most profound principles of magic were written - it was used to teach the magic to the giants - into six pieces and changed the letters on the tablet into the god's characters. They can only be understood by the gods or those who are as powerful. This way, nobody could learn the knowledge. But there is a method! I'll explain.<br>
Wow, this is really interesting, isn't it?<br>
