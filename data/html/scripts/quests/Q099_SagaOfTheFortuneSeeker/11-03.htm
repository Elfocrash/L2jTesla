There is no way to avoid meeting the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font>. Yes, because he has the fifth Resonance Amulet.<br>
If you go to the Imperial Tomb, you can confront him by entering the Four Sepulchers. If you go to the Shrine of the Loyal, you must attack his minions as you see them. Then the Archon of Halisha will appear. OK, leave now! MMMMMAH!!! This is the kiss of luck!</body></html>
