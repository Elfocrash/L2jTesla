You can feel the Resonance Amulet? It must be this small piece of stone that I stole from the Benandantis. It's the fragment of the fourth Resonance Amulet. However, for it to work properly, we have to find the missing piece and put them together.<br>
The rest of the Resonance Amulet is called the sacred stone of wisdom and is worshiped as an idol by the uncivilized tribes in this area. The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos each have one. To get the stone from them, you must first win their trust. Since they are wild and warlike, I don't know which tribe you should approach.<br>
