<html><body>Chief Inspector Mond:<br>
Do you know who I am? I'm an inspector from the Bronze Key Guild, but that's just a superficial job title!<br>
What I'm about to tell you is known by only a few people in the whole Dwarven kingdom! Listen carefully! I won't repeat it.<br>
The Bronze Key Guild was originally formed to resist the von Hellmann family that tried to take over the Elmore Kingdom and the Benandanti cartel that followed them. It was an elite group, consisting of only Dwarves with the very best skills.<br>
Our guild has watched you for a long time. We saw you pass the cruel test of Master Toma and get your Scavenger license, and when you made 7 journeyman's rings and passed the Trial of the Guildsman. Some time ago, we concluded that a Dwarf with your willpower and acumen deserves to be a member of our guild. Now I have an offer for you. Will you join us in defeating the Benandanti cartel?<br>
