Very well! Go to <font color="LEVEL">Messenger Wahkan</font> of the Ketra Orcs. They will be hiring mercenaries. This is a good opportunity to gain their trust!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">sacred stone of wisdom</font> we are looking for is possessed by <font color="LEVEL">soul guide Asefa</font>, the chief shaman of the Ketra Orcs. If things aren't going well, you can switch sides and approach the Varka Silenos tribe.</body></html>
