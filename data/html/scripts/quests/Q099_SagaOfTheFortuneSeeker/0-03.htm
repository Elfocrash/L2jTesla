<html><body>Chief Inspector Mond:<br>
First you must speak with <font color="LEVEL">Pamela Aprodia</font>, the agent dispatched to Goddard. Although she's not a Dwarf, she's an excellent agent who's been working with us for a long time. She's probably investigating the six tablets in <font color="LEVEL">Goddard Castle Town</font> right now. You'd better go there and meet her.<br>
One more thing. Before you leave, read this report. It's an Investigative Report on the spirit protecting one of the tablets. If you follow the Benandantis, you will probably come across this spirit. You should read it now.<br>
You'd better get going! May Maphr be with you!</body></html>
