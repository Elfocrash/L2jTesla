Make no mistake; we are forced to collaborate with the Humans for only one reason: to prevent the hated Elves from acquiring influence over the Kamael.<br>
How the goddess Eva saw fit to award the Innadril Elves supremacy is beyond belief! Ah, and to think that those wretched Innadril Elves then allowed themselves to be tricked by the Elves of the Elf Village, tarnishing the honor of all Dark Elves. Ay de mi!<br>
Remember this: the Elves intentionally tried to exclude us from the Giran Treaty summit. Only through the request of the Adventurers Guild were we permitted to finally send a representative to the proceedings. That insult to Dark Elves will not be forgotten -- or forgiven! But I suppose it was naive of us to expect any decency from those cowardly Elves, skulking forever under their so-called Mother Tree.<br>
