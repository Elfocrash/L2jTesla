I already told you, the one who led the Kamael since the beginning is Eva, goddess of water. The reason Eva chose the Elves to lead the Kamael in her stead is not because of the unconditional affection that the Orcs or Dark Elves talk about.<br>
No, it is rather that wise Eva wishes to restore order to this chaotic world by combining the magic of the Elves with the strength of the Kamael. After much study, we Magisters believe that only the Elves can manage the Kamael's amazing abilities. To our great sadness, however, the other races -- including the Humans -- suspect us of more selfish motives.<br>
