Most commoners believe that the Human race was created by Einhasad. But an adventurer of your stature certainly knows that that is false; Humans were in actuality the first creation of Gran Kain...and his first failure.<br>
That is why the other races hold us in such low regard. But despite that ignoble beginning, we have grown from the lowest to the most exceptional people in the world!<br>
Our civilization is unmatched, but we still cannot match the physical superiority the other races have by virtue of their birth. As a result, we are in constant danger of being exterminated! Not a month goes by that we don't catch some cunning Elf or sly Orc skulking around, spying on us even here! Does that make you uncomfortable? It should! It is only through our wits that we have survived and thrived this long.<br>
Ah, but the discovery of the Kamael means we have been given a great opportunity to correct the imbalance!<br>
