Yes! And take this mark I give you as a token of good faith with which to convince him. If the Humans persist in using the power of Orcs or Dark Elves to divide Elves and the Kamael, our world will descend even further into chaos.<br>
But I for one harbor the hope that the Humans will understand our purpose and support us. Although theirs is a tragic history, through their own wisdom and power they have built a powerful civilization. We Elves do not wish them to again stray into foolishness and attempt to thwart the will of the gods, as they did when their race was still young.<br>
A Human here in Giran is in agreement with me and wishes to tell you about his personal experience with the Kamael. His name is <font color="LEVEL">Sir Kristof Rodemai</font>, and you will find him near the Warrior Guild. Listen to him before you continue your journey!
