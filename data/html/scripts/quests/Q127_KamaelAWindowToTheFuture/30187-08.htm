Excellent! Your decision warms my heart. Now commit this password to memory: <font color="LEVEL">Name that Opens the Future</font>. And take this mark, which is called the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Future</font>. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Alder in Schuttgart Castle Town</font> and he will give you his report, as well as the mark you will require to obtain the next collaborator's report. When you have collected a report from each collaborator, deliver the information to Dominic.<br>
By the way, the quickest way to reach Alder in Schuttgart Castle Town is to pass through Rune Town. May Gran Kain smile on your journey!
