Yes. There is much we still have to learn about the Kamael, but we know beyond a doubt that they are a very powerful race.<br>
It is possible that they may even be physically stronger than the Orcs, as well as possessing even more devilish powers than the Dark Elves. But even if they were individually weak, their numbers alone would be a powerful aid. The other races know this, which is why they are all attempting to subvert our relations with the Kamael. The struggle for supremacy has already begun!<br>
