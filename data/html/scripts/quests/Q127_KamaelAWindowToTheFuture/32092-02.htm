You must realize that the Iron Gate Guild to which I belong didn't agree to this because we wanted to help the Humans. Our interest stems from that fact that a Dwarf allegedly first discovered the existence of the Kamael, which gives us certain priority rights regarding them.<br>
I know that the Elves and Humans look down their noses at us, seeing us as nothing more than tinkerers and traders. But we are an ancient and a proud people, and our Dwarven law is sacred to us. Accordingly, we regard the rights we have gained as untouchable.<br>
