Yes. The Kamael are as fierce as fire and as strong as the stones of the Sacred Plateau. From the beginning, they were born and bred to be a warrior race. So Tarkai Zu Duda-Mara learned from their chief.<br>
Why do you think the other races are so eager for the Kamael's friendship? It may seem as though they see the new race simply as a means of advancing their own power, but the deeper truth is that they are all are motivated by fear.<br>
That is the same reason why we Orcs are hated by the other races; they fear our strength and prowess in battle. Therefore, go and say this to the Humans: We Orcs have no need to exploit the Kamael, but wish instead to welcome them as our blood kin from ancient times. Oppose us and our bond with the Kamael will grow only stronger, until no power on this world can withstand our combined might. Do you understand?<br>
