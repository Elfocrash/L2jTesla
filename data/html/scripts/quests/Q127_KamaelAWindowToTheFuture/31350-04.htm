Can't resist the urge to find out the truth, eh? You want to know, as I do, who exactly are the Kamael?<br>
Make no mistake, my young friend, I am only interested in one thing: I wish to use them in order to shake this sorry, sad world to its very foundations. That prating noble asked me to find an adventurer qualified to discover what each of the races know about the Kamael. Why? My net spreads much further afield than his, that's why, and he thinks that nothing that might cause embarrassment can be traced back to him. Inbred fool!<br>
Join my cause and you will be suitably rewarded for your part. Of course, the greater reward may be the truth you discover about the Kamael race itself.<br>
Now then, take this mark and to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Klaus Blackbird in the Town of Oren.</font> Give it to him and he will advise you on exactly what you must do. Waste not a moment!
