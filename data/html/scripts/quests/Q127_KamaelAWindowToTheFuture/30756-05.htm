<html><body>Sir Kristof Rodemai:<br>
That is all I can say at this time. But it should be enough -- it is certainly enough to cost me my life, should it fall into the wrong hands. But thank you for hearing me. Perhaps you should leave now, however, to avoid drawing suspicion onto either of us.<br>
According to the information I have gathered, your next destination should be <font color="LEVEL">Rune Township</font>. If you meet with <font color="LEVEL">Priest Dominic</font>, I trust that you will not betray my confidence; for my part, I will say nothing about your mission. Good luck to you -- I have known you only briefly, and I doubt we shall meet again in this world, but my heart is lighter knowing that our fate is in the hands of someone like yourself. Farewell!
