Hush, child! The walls have ears, you know! Now listen: I, as a chief of the Warrior Guild, agreed to follow Dominic's plan. I don't know exactly what he told you, but I wholeheartedly agree with his insistence that authority over the Kamael should be transferred to us, the Humans.<br>
That is why I am willing to aid Dominic -- not simply for my sake, but for the sake of all Humans. We must not allow a few second-class gods to unfairly favor other undeserving races. This is our time in history! This is our world!<br>
