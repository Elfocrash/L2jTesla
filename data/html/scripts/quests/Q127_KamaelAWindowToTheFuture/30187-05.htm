According to legend, Gran Kain wrote a tome about the Kamael and hid it somewhere in this world. Now that book has been found, by a Dwarf of all people. It was clear that Gran Kain's intention was to unite the Humans, his own first children, and the Kamael in a mighty alliance.<br>
But now the Elves have become involved, threatening that plan. Unless they are stopped, they and the other races will subvert the Humans by asserting their own control over the Kamael.<br>
That cannot be allowed; we cannot lose this opportunity to fulfill Gran Kain's will!<br>
