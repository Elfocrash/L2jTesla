Very well. All that is left is to give you the mark you require; here it is. Against my better judgment, I must tell you the name of the Elven collaborator. Listen closely! Find <font color="LEVEL">Magister Juris</font> in Giran Castle Town.<br>
Once you have heard what he says, find me again and tell me when the opportunity presents itself. I want to hear for myself what words come forth from his moon-face! Be not deceived, however, he is a deep and treacherous creature.<br>
Be on your way, and may Shilen guide you on your journey! I will await your report.
