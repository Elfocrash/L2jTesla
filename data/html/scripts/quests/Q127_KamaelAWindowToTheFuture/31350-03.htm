Calm yourself, my friend. I will satisfy your hot-headed curiosity.<br>
Noble Elmore sought me out not long ago and asked a particular favor of me. It concerned a lost race, separate from the five that you know, a race known as the Kamael.<br>
Ah, how I wish you could see your expression! Priceless! But I suppose that your shock is entirely natural. Silence your skeptical tongue -- what I tell you is completely true, on my word of honor. This divine race not only exists, it is known to the leaders of each of the five races. But they are vexed that information about the Kamael is so sparse.<br>
Are you up to the challenge of finding the truth? I will offer you the task if you desire it. Accept and many of your questions will be answered...<br>
