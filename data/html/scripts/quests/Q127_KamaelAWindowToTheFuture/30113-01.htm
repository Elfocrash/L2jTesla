You are the one sent by the Human Warrior Guild, eh? Oh, forgive me! That came out rather more loudly than I had intended. Let me tell you that according to the rumors I hear, many Elves are excited about the chance to build close ties to the Kamael race.<br>
Our relationship with the Kamael is closely connected with Eva's blessings, which is why many Elves believe that this will be a holy union. I suppose the one who sent you, as well as the other races' collaborators, will be quite dismayed to hear this news. They will undoubtedly suspect that I only agreed to participate in this venture in order to oppose the Elves.<br>
