<html><body>High Prefect Aklan:<br>
The world is abuzz with news of the Kamael, and the other races fall over themselves in their rush to send emissaries to the new race. Fools! It was not the Dwarves who discovered the Kamael, you know. Long before their disappearance, they left traces of themselves in ancient Orc legends.<br>
In their greed and fear, the other races are blind to this fact: the Kamael will not ally themselves with any of them. Their blood is valiant, ancient and pure, as is the blood that beats from Orc hearts and flows through Orc veins.<br>
Hearing of their reappearance is like receiving word that our lost brothers and sisters have returned. We welcome them!<br>
