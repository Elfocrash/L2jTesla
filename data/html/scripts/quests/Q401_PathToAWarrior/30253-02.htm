Recently, the lord announced that he would restore all the villages that became ruins during the war and solicited to the warriors guild for soldiers to do away with the undead. If you want to prove that you have the qualities of a Warrior, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font> and fight with the <font color="LEVEL">tracker skeletons</font>!<br>
The skeletons in the ruins are the spirits of poor soldiers that lost their lives cruelly during the war and become undead. Bring back <font color="LEVEL">ten rusted swords</font> that they used. While you perform this task, take this mark with you, since you have become a member of our warriors guild for a short time.<br>
What? Difficult? What are you saying! Twenty years ago when I was about your age, the witch Cleo led undead troops into the Castle of Gludio. My comrades and I fought against hundreds of skeletons in just one night! And here you are whining about killing just ten tracker skeletons?! No more unnecessary words, now be off with you!
