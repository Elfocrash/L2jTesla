You are still too inexperienced. The damage to your armor and the callus on your palm show me that plainly. Come back after you are more seasoned. At that time, I will be willing to test you to determine if you are indeed qualified to be a true Warrior.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 19 and above.)
