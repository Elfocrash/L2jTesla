<html><body>Master Auron:<br>
Have you returned? Well, I knew you would be able to do the job magnificently. I hereby give you the <font color="LEVEL">medallion of the Warrior</font>. It is proof that you have earned the qualifications to change profession to a Warrior. Take it and go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Ramos</font> of our guild. He will change your profession to a Warrior. He is the one right over there.<br>
I don't know how your future will turn out, but I hope you do not forget the warrior's creed that I've taught you. Until we meet again, may the goddess of victory smile on you!
