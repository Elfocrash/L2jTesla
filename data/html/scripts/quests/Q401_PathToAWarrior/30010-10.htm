<html><body>Master Auron:<br>
How do you hunt a poison spider with a rusty sword? Look here, fellow, do you know what the creed of our warriors guild is? It's <font color="LEVEL">stay alive even in the worst conditions</font>. There is no law that says you will always be at an advantage in a fight against your opponent. However, in any situation, you can win if you keep your wits about you.<br>
Think of this ... do you think a knight armed with luxurious Steel armor and a Steel sword has achieved a real victory after killing a farmer who is armed with a wooden spear? True victory is rolling in the mud and taking a beating, then picking up a stone and striking for your opponent's head. It is that gruesome. Do you understand what I'm saying?<br>
