Good! Once you've passed through the southern gate of the village, to the left you'll see the windmills of Windmill Hill. There you'll find giant poison spiders and arachnid trackers.<br>
You'll also find many spiders on the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds west of the Fellmere Lake over the northern mountains. Bring twenty of their legs to me.<br>
You must use only the sword of trial to kill them! Do you understand? Get going!
