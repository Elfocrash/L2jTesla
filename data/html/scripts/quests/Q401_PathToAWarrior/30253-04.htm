Ho, you have brought back ten rusted swords used by the tracker skeletons of the ruins. I can tell from the Gracian characters engraved on the blade -- the undead of the ruins are all spirits of the soldiers that died during war with Gracia.<br>
Anyway, many thanks for your trouble. Here, take one of these rusted sword. Why? Because that is none other than the sword of trial!<br>
What is that dumbfounded look on your face? Don't be unreasonable. Look here, young fellow, did you think we warriors had a magical sword with splendid ornaments? If I say that is the sword of trial, then understand that it is so, and be off! Here, I will write you a letter to take to <font color="LEVEL">Master Auron</font>!
