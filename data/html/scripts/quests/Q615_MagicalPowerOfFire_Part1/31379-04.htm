<html><body>Soul Guide Udan Mardui:<br>
Oh, were you successful? Is this the Red Totem? I feel the strong energy of fire! I didn't think that Ketra Orcs could use this mysterious power!<br>
In honor of your wisdom and courage, I hereby bestow upon you this holy relic of our tribe, the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>.<br>
Now, I, Udan Mardui, will discover the secret contained within the totem. Come back to see me later. I'll have more work for you.
