<html><body>Soul Guide Udan Mardui:<br>
Do you feel the power of Asefa engulfing the battleground, comrade?<br>
You must go to the Ketra Orc Outpost and steal the Red Totem, the source of his power. You mustn't confront it's guardians directly! If they discover you, you'll never get the totem.<br>
Once you do this, I'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>, a sacred relic of our tribe!<br>
The Red Totem is locked inside a box, so don't forget to take the Thief Key with you. I pray that you are victorious!
