<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br>
Have you read all the inscriptions on the tablets? Daimon clouds my memory so that I can't remember the things about him. Thus, the only ways to defeat him are recorded on the tablets. They are left here and there throughout this area.<br>
But, Daimon's forces must have been destroying them. You don't have much time, my hero!
