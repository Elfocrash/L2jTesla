<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br>
Do you know about Daimon the White-Eyed? When Einhasad ripped Argos apart and scattered the pieces throughout the land, I became the bright side of Argos and Daimon became the dark side.<br>
Daimon has been expanding his powerbase, spreading his evil influence even further. He dreams of expanding his reach globally, but each time, his efforts have been thwarted by heroes like you!<br>
Now, his force is spreading and his henchmen are wandering about in this land. Will you take up the fight against this demonic scourge?<br>
First, you must study the methods that past heroes used to stop him.<br>
You'll find stone tablets describing their accomplishments in several parts of this region. Read them and report back to me what you learn.
