<html><body>Blacksmith Hilda:<br>
So you met with Vulcan, did you? Did he give you an earful of his madness? Well, he's mad about flame, but the rewards he offers are real. Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">monsters in the Forge of the Gods</font>, collect the flames you find, and go to him; he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe if you bring him <font color="LEVEL">1000 flames</font>.<br>
If you gather even more flames, you might see about meeting Vulcan's younger brother <font color="LEVEL">Rooney</font>. He's as mad as his brother, and he's engaged in the same quest. <font color="LEVEL">Bring him 1200 flames and he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe</font>. Rooney wanders from here to there, so he's not easy to find...but it might be worth your while to deal with him.
