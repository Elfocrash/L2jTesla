<html><body>Blacksmith Hilda:<br>
I have a story for you. Have you heard tell of <font color="LEVEL">Vulcan</font>, the blacksmith? Now, all us blacksmiths have much to say about fire — we depend on it for our livelihood. Vulcan, though, he spoke of nothing else, and his talk was the marvel of all who heard it. He said that the fire was the actual life of the blacksmith, and could think of nothing but ways to make his fire hotter and fiercer.<br>
Eventually, he followed his notions right into the deeps of the <font color="LEVEL">Forge of the Gods</font>, where he said he could collect and use all the fire he would want. It's a horribly dangerous place, and he's looking for those who can accompany him, adventurers who are not shy of danger and who can help him collect the flames. Do you reckon to be interested?<br>
