Very well, then. Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">monsters in the Forge of the Gods</font>, collect the flames you find there, and bring them to Vulcan. He's mad, but he's a canny blacksmith; he'll give you an S-grade weapon recipe if you can bring him <font color="LEVEL">1000 flames</font>.<br>
You may have heard tell of Vulcan's younger brother <font color="LEVEL">Rooney</font>. No? Well, he's as mad as his brother is, and perhaps even cannier as a blacksmith. He's a wandering lad, but he has a lot of different S-grade weapon recipes. <font color="LEVEL">Give Rooney 1200 flames, and he'll reward you with an S-grade weapon recipe.</font> If you can find him in his wanderings, it might be a good idea for you to meet with him too.
