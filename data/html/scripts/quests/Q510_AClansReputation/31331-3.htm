Thank you, thank you! Legend has it that these creatures are extremely vicious... Oh, but I'm sure they will pose no more trouble to such a powerful clan than a kitten with her claws! So, will you go to the Primeval Isle and slay a <font color="LEVEL">Tyrannosaurus</font>?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Naturally, we don't expect you personally to slay the creature.</font> There is no rule requiring a clan leader to brandish his own sword in these matters. <font color="LEVEL">Simply stay nearby and watch your clan members slay the Tyrannosaurus and return here with its claws.</font><font color="LEVEL">It's vital that the claw be undamaged, you understand, which means...uh, well, it's probably best that you capture the creature before slaying it. I hope that doesn't complicate the task for you!</font><br>
I'll be here anxiously awaiting your good news.
