Why, this is a letter Prias left behind! And it is torn into pieces... I am sure he ripped it up while he was trying to leave us a message. Anyway, let's quickly assemble the pieces and read the letter.<br>
Hmm... If I put this one on top... Ah! At last, I can read it. <font color="LEVEL">"I write in haste. Emergency! They have kidnapped me and are planning to attack Gludin. The Ol Mahum scouts are taking me to the Neutral Zone in the Elven Forest. It's an emergency..."</font> The letter ends here.<br>
Now I know... The reason the Ol Mahum showed up in the ruins... The reason they kidnapped Prias... At least now we know where he is so there is a slight hope, but can we save him? I must ask you another favor. We must prepare for the upcoming attack, so please go and save Prias...<br>
Every moment is critical! If you meet Prias, give him this. This is a letter that explains the circumstances and a Medicinal Herb that will cure his wounds. To go to the <font color="LEVEL">Neutral Zone</font>, cross this bridge in front of you and follow the road north. It is where Dark Elven and Elven soldiers stand face to face against each other.
