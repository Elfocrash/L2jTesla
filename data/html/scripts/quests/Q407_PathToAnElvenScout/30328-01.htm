So you want to be an Elven Scout? Hmm ... it is not my place to recommend you as an Elven Scout without reason, so I would like to see your skills first. By chance, there is a task you may be perfect for. Prove your skills as an Elven Fighter through this task. What do you say, will you accept the assignment?<br>
