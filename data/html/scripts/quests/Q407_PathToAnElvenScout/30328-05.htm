<html><body>Master Reisa:<br>
If that is the case, I will explain the task to you now. Not long ago, Guard Moretti of our village came to me. He said that a colleague who on patrols with him was lost and they still don't know his whereabouts. So he wanted the help of the Elves who are skilled in the arts of investigation. He is a very devoted youth, and I have always thought very highly of him, so I accepted his request.<br>
So, I am about to give you that task. Finding a missing person requires great investigative skills, alertness, and lucidity. Moreover, you never know what dangers lie ahead, so you must also have great combat skills. Solving this task is a good opportunity for you to prove your abilities.<br>
Please<font color="LEVEL">, go to Guard Moretti and listen to the facts of the case and help him</font>. Moretti is at the east of the village, standing at the entrance where you can see the bridge. If you go with no references, he may not know you, so I will write you a letter. Please take this and go seek Moretti.
