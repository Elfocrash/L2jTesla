I have heard from Moretti. You must be the one who took charge of investigating this case. You must be going to the Ol Mahum's campgrounds. If you follow this road west, you will arrive at a fork in the road. Follow the road that heads southwest and you will reach the campgrounds. It used to be a place where the Gracian army made its camp, but it was abandoned for some time before the remaining army of Ol Mahums settled down there.<br>
Prias and I were classmates, so please find out where he is. I hope nothing has happened to him ... Pray, be careful.
