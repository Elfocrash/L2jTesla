<html><body>Guard Moretti:<br>
Ah, you have finally returned. Is Prias safe? What about his letter? Hmm...<br>
Ah, I do not know whether my friend is truly courageous or merely rash. I can't believe he is staying behind to patrol. Anyway, he is very obliged to you. He may seem a little impolite on the outside, but he has a very kind heart. It's just that he is awkward when it comes to expressing his gratitude.<br>
Now our guards must prepare and set off for the battle. We must teach the Ol Mahum stragglers a lesson. At any rate, your distinguished services have greatly helped this case. I have spoken to the captain of the guards and he has already prepared an <font color="LEVEL">Honorary Guard</font>. If you take this to <font color="LEVEL">Master Reisa</font>, you will be able to get what you want. Well, I have many things to prepare, so goodbye.
