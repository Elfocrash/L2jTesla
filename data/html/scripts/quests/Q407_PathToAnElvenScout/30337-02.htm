All right, It's time to tell you what is going on.<br>
A fortnight ago, I set off on a regular patrol of the ruins with a few of my colleagues. However, while we were looking around the reconstruction site, a group of <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum patrollers</font> suddenly attacked us! In our experience, they usually don't appear at the ruins, but for some reason they suddenly showed up and attacked us. During the surprise attack, we were unable to keep our formation and fought back as best we could to make our escape. It was total chaos as we continued to try and fight our way free of the trap ... I still get shivers when I think of it!<br>
When we had won free and regrouped, we discovered our problem. One of our party, Prias, was nowhere to be seen. We didn't know what to do, since he had vanished while we were preoccupied. So we returned to the village as quickly as we could, gathered more of our colleagues and returned to the ruins. But no matter how much we searched, we could not find a clue to his whereabouts. Since then, we are continuing our investigations, but we still have not found a clue to his whereabouts. So in the end, I requested the help of Reisa. Poor Prias ... I am really worried.<br>
