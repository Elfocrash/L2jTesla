Oh, what is this? Prias's Letter! Ah... seeing that it is torn, I'm sure he tore it up while he was writing us a message because he was discovered.<br>
Unfortunately, the letter is so badly torn that I cannot tell exactly what he wanted to say... 'Ol Mahum... Urgent... Attack... Elves...' I wonder what the Elves have to do with this... anyway, I cannot read any more. Do you have any other torn letter pieces? Since this is the only clue that we have, I think it would be best to collect the remaining torn letter pieces.
