<html><body>Master Reisa:<br>
I see you have received an Honorary Guard certificate. I have already heard of your achievements. Guard Moretti highly praised you. Now I can gladly recommend you as an Elven Scout. Who but a skilled Elf like you could become an Elven Scout?<br>
In the future, I hope you train still further, to become a magnificent Plainswalker or Silver Ranger. Now take my Recommendation and go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Rains</font>. He will change your profession to Elven Scout. May the power of Eva be with you.
