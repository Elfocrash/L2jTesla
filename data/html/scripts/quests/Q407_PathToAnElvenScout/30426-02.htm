<html><body>Prias:<br>
You are very lucky. You came just when the others had left and only the sentries remained ... Anyway, I am free, thanks to you. Thank you very much. Ah, Moretti sent me a letter? And an herb as well ... he is a wonderful friend. I begin to feel faint just by thinking about my captivity, and the torments I've had to endure.<br>
The scoundrels here just now were scouts of the group that was going to attack our village. They were planning to do their work in the Elven Forest where Humans cannot enter easily. Since you arrived at the right time, we can alert the people of the danger.<br>
Take this to Moretti and tell him that it will be hard for me to return immediately ... Tell him I will take a closer look at the situation here and join the guards later.<br>
I am entirely in your debt. Thank you very much. To think that I would receive help from the Elves in my lifetime! <font color="LEVEL">On your way back, please take this letter to Moretti.</font> I beg you!
