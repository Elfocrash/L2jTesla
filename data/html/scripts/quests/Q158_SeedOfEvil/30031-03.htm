<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
I have had great intuition since my youth and have received warnings about disasters or dangers in my sleep. Eventually that has caused me to walk the path of faith. After becoming a priest, I have received the message of the gods more clearly in my dreams. Lately those occurrences have been rare, but all of a sudden, I have begun to consecutively dream very unsettling nightmares. The dream was unclear at first, but finally became clear last night.<br>
I finally realized that the dream was a warning against the foreboding evil that approaches our Talking Island. Oh, it is frightening indeed. A great evil power is targeting Talking Island. But as of now, I do not know the identity of that great evil ... all I know is that a devil presumed to be a worshipper of this evil is plotting something in the basements of the Elven Ruins.<br>
That is why all I know at the moment is that the evil worshipper must be found and eliminated. We must get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">seed of evil</font> or it may draw a great evil into our island. I would like you to perform that task.<br>
