Thank you. You have completed a dangerous task.<br>
What ...? He called upon the name of <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> at his death ...? Beleth was an evil Sorcerer, also called a devil. Long ago, his powers were sealed by the Mystics of the Ivory Tower. However, they say that no one knows whether he is still dead or alive. That a devil worshipping Beleth should appear on this island ... This is no common thing at all ... I have the feeling that this incident is the beginning of a greater plague that will come upon us in the future ...<br>
This <font color="LEVEL">Clay Tablet</font>? Have you obtained it from that devil? Clay tablets were used by Mystics in the Elmoreden Age. I don't know how this is related to Beleth ... I guess I will have to ask Gallint of Einhovant's School of Wizardry, who knows how to read the ancient language, to translate this for me ...<br>
Oh. I have been so occupied with my thoughts, I nearly forgot. Please take this. This is a small gift for having performed such a difficult task. Please do not decline, just accept my gift.
