<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
Brave warrior, to seek out and eradicate the <font color="LEVEL">seed of evil</font>, you must travel to the abandoned <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>. For directions to the abandoned Elven Ruins, ask Guard Kenyos who stands at the northern entrance of the village.<br>
In my dreams the seed of evil that will lead a great evil into the world is lying dormant in the deepest depths of the cellars, gathering power. The seed of evil took the form of a <font color="LEVEL">devil with large, grotesque red wings</font>, reminiscent of a bat. They came in a group, but one of them radiated an evil force greater than the rest. I am sure that he is the leader of this group.<br>
I pray to Einhasad that our small power of good may be sufficient to defeat the darkness.
