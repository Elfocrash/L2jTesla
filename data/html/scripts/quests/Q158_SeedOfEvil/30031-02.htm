<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
Actually, I have been plagued by an unexplainable fear lately. I think it is the reoccurring nightmare that I have been having recently. I have had superior intuition since I was young, and have often received divine signs in my dreams. I think that my nightmares are a warning from the gods. I do not know its exact identity yet, but I feel that an evil power is spreading its hands over the island.<br>
I only hope that this uneasy fear is a figment of my imagination ... I am not sure yet ... But perhaps even you may have to fight this evil.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 21 and above.)
