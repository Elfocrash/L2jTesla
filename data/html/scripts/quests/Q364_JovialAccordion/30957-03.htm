Is this too complicated for you? Would you like for me to explain it again? Take the black beer from Jonas' <font color="LEVEL">beer chest</font> located in the warehouse and take it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Sabrin</font>. Then go to the grocery store and take Sonia's Event Clothes from the <font color="LEVEL">clothes chest </font> and take them to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Xaber</font>.
