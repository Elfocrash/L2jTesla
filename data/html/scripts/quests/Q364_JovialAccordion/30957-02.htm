Please get some black beer from Chef Jonas and take it to Trader Sabrin. Jonas keeps his beer in a <font color="LEVEL">beer chest</font> and stores it in a warehouse... He becomes quite cross when asked for favors, so it would be best if you handled this without talking to him.<br>
Also, go to the grocery store in the village and find a <font color="LEVEL">clothes chest</font>. You will find it near Trader Sonia. Take the contents of that chest to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Xaber</font>. Here are the keys to the two chests. Good luck!
