In a few weeks, the mass of darkness dedicated to Shilen and Gran Kain will be held. <font color="LEVEL">Shilen's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass. Unfortunately, those of other races, like yourself, cannot participate in the hunt. But you may come and watch if you'd like.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Dark Elven character.)
