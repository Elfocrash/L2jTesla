Have you found all <font color="LEVEL">thirteen</font> Dark Bezoars? It won't be easy. Even if it is the hunt season, only one out of five animals will have the Bezoar.<br>
Now! Go out into the forest again and hunt <font color="LEVEL">brown keltirs</font> and <font color="LEVEL">gray wolves</font>. Shilen's Hunt continues even as we speak. Glory to the mother of the abyss!
