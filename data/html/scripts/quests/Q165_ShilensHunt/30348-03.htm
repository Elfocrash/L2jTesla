Among the <font color="LEVEL">brown keltirs</font> and <font color="LEVEL">gray wolves</font> in the forest, there are rare animals that bear a bezoar on their bellies, as a sign of being chosen by Shilen. This bezoar is black and sparkles like a jewel. Known as the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Bezoar</font>, this stone is not only beautiful, but possesses strong magical powers.<br>
The hunter who brings back <font color="LEVEL">thirteen</font> Dark Bezoars is given the honorary title of "Great Hunter," and also presented with the reward that the abyssal celebrants have put up. Everyone is given the chance to compete for the prize. Of course, that includes you, too. In the name of Shilen, who takes in all that is living, may your hunt bring good results.
