In a few weeks, the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> dedicated to Shilen and Gran Kain will be held. <font color="LEVEL">Shilen's Hunt</font> will be held for ten days before the mass. The purpose of the ceremony is to hunt wild animals in the name of the goddess and offer them at the temple. Of course, the act of offering a sacrifice is only symbolic -- in the past, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies for the winter during our long period of hiding in the darkness.<br>
During the hunt, all the youth in the village, armed with swords and bows, go out into the woods to hunt. The fervor is impressive -- the Humans who witnessed it called it a "wild hunt". I think you should definitely participate when the hunt begins.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 3 and above.)
