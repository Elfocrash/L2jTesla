<html><body>Thalia:<br>
May the blessings of the starlight be upon you. You have recovered Talin's Spear! Thank you very much for your trouble.<br>
Now that we have both the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Purity</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear</font>, we can set off in search of the Water of Life. This will bring the utmost sacrifice and the greatest sorrow...<br>
We must pierce <font color="LEVEL">Eva's Unicorn</font>, the guardian of our forest, with Talin's Spear and collect its <font color="LEVEL">tears</font> in the Grail of Purity. That is the 'Water of Life' itself. In order to recover the life of the Mother Tree, we must sacrifice the life of Eva's dearest incarnation, the unicorn...<br>
Do you understand what I have asked of you? May the Goddess forgive us for what we are about to do...
