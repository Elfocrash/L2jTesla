Ah, the <font color="LEVEL">Pure Mithril Cup</font>... It is indeed a masterpiece. Occasionally the Dwarves show their true worth. In order to transform a Mithril Cup into a Grail of Purity we must have <font color="LEVEL">'Stardust'</font>. It is a silvery powder, said to be sprinkled by the spirits of starlight. Only Dark Elves have the skill to gather it.<br>
We must enlist their assistance to obtain the Stardust. Dark Elves are our dark shadow... Although we may never forgive them, our survival and that of all the forests in this land depends on their cooperation in this matter.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elves Initiation Altar</font> and meet a <font color="LEVEL">Shaman named Arkenia</font>. She knows how to gather Stardust. I shall write you a letter, but I am afraid that the Dark Elves will not cooperate gladly...
