The Mother Tree is the origin of life and a shelter for spirits. Rays of heaven shine through her branches and life branches forth from her roots. She is the center of the universe where the sky and earth become as one.<br>
The Elves and the Mother Tree have been inextricably linked from the very beginning... After death our spirits return to the shelter of the Mother Tree.<br>
Our mother of souls is dying.<br>
