You have found all of the pieces of Talin's spear! Reassembling this will be easy for me! I studied the art of weaponry with Hierarch Terestian of the lake fairies.<br>
Now! Take this spear and return to <font color="LEVEL">Thalia</font>. Please find the Water of Life so that the Mother Tree may become green and healthy once more. May Sayha of the Winds guide you safely home...
