Oh, really? so price is no object is it? Hmm...<br>
...Then how about this? I cannot tell you the recipe, but if you bring me 'Andariel's Book' that you Elves of light think so precious, I will give you some Stardust.<br>
The book was actually a part of 'Kaysha's Revelation' which contained Shilen's secret, but the followers of Einhasad edited it for their own purposes.<br>
This book made by the hypocrites of the light is certainly corrupted, but perhaps I could find some clues about Kaysha's Revelation. As far as I know, <font color="LEVEL">Andariel's book</font> is in the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad in Gludin</font>. I care not how you get it, just bring it to me.<br>
Produce the book and I will give you some <font color="LEVEL">Stardust</font>. I swear by the Gaze of Abyss that this promise will be kept.
