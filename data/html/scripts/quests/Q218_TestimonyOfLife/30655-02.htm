<html><body>Isael Silvershadow:<br>
It was the Leto Lizardmen who wrested the spear from the lake fairies. It is said that the Shamans and Chiefs of their group broke the spear into many pieces and divided them among themselves. <font color="LEVEL">The spear was divided into six pieces: the blade, the shaft, and four jewels that adorned the handle...</font><br>
These wretched creatures are taking the pieces to Dragon Valley to destroy the spear there. This hostility is not typical of the lizardmen... I am certain that someone is controlling them.<br>
But the most important matter is the recovery of the spear. My friend, I beseech you. Find the <font color="LEVEL">Shamans and Chiefs of the Leto Lizardmen </font>, and recover all the pieces of the spear that they have taken from us. Time is of the essence. I don't think they have gone very far. I suspect that they might be somewhere on the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen, not far from here.</font> May Sayha of the Winds guide your way...
