<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
So, I see that you have returned with the Water of Life. Please forgive me, but I neglected to mention before that we must sacrifice Eva's unicorn. This animal, blessed by the Goddess, our guardian of the forest, must give her life to save our precious Mother Tree.<br>
This sacrifice, along with this Water of Life will certainly restore health to the Mother Tree at last...<br>
Now take this amulet and go see <font color="LEVEL">Master Cardien of the Town of Dion</font>. May the splendor of Mithril forever shine on the forest and the lake!
