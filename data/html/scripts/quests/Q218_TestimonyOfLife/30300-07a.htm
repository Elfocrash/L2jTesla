What a pity, I thought Elves all had good memories. I will tell you once more. First get <font color="LEVEL">10 units of Pure Mithril Ore</font>. You can find it by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Basilisks</font> in the Death Pass, north of Giran.<br>
Next,<font color="LEVEL">20 bottles of ant soldier's acid</font>. You can find these ants in the caves of the Wastelands of Gludio.<br>
Also <font color="LEVEL">20 Wyrm Talons</font>. Wyrms are often seen in Giran.
