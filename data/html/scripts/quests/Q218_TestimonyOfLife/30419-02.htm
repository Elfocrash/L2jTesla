So what if the Mother Tree dies, what is that to us?<br>
You Elves of Light turned your backs on us and treated us as outcasts. We were obliged to sever our relationship with our beloved forest and earth and take refuge in the shadows! Consequently we are not dependent on the Mother Tree as you are, and now we are the ones with true freedom.<br>
Why not join us in the shadows, and escape the deceptive clutches of the Mother Tree?<br>
The death of the Mother Tree means nothing to us. Stardust is also useless, so don't bother asking for its secrets!<br>
