The Mother Tree... Mother of all forests and Elves... The heart of the Elven tribe...<br>
Long ago... Thanks to the sacrifice of the very first guardian, the Mother Tree was reborn in the land filled with dead bodies. She gave the tree life by sacrificing her own, and becoming one with the dying tree.<br>
Until this day her shape remains in the stem of the Mother Tree. Her noble sacrifice must never be forgotten.<br>
Now once again the tree is dying...<br>
Our tribe's very existence is at stake. If we are to survive, it will be thanks to the help and sacrifice of young Elves like you. Will you join our struggle?<br>
