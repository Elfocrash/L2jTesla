<html><body>Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
First I will need a very pure, specially-made Varnish to refine Pure Mithril. Using normal Varnish to refine Pure Mithril will destroy it. This special Varnish is derived from the secretions of giant ants.<br>
You will find these ants in the Wastelands of Gludio. There are hundreds of giant ants in the underground there... Kill only <font color="LEVEL">ant soldiers</font> and collect the <font color="LEVEL">acid from their body</font> in a bottle. 20 bottles will be enough.<br>
And last, we will need <font color="LEVEL">Wyrm Talons</font>. Carving a Mithril surface requires a strong and sharp knife, normal knives and chisels are not suitable. I need a chisel made from Wyrm Talons. Please get me 20 unbroken talons.<br>
So, the 3 materials we need are: Pure Mithril Ore, Ant Soldier Acid and Wyrm Talons. You can remember all this, right? Good luck, Elf!
