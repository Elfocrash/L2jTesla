Thank you for your help, brother of forest. Here is your <font color="LEVEL">copy of Andariel's Book</font>. Although you haven't mentioned it, I know that you seek to save the Mother Tree... This book should be of great help to you...<br>
Your faith in the Goddess of harmony and light will guide your path. Listen carefully to the blowing of the wind, the trickling of water and the whisper of starlight. The Goddess will always watch over us.
