I have terrible news! <font color="LEVEL">Talin's Spear has been stolen on its way here!</font> It is said that the lake spirits who were bringing the sword from Innadril were attacked by the lizardmen who massacred them and absconded with the spear.<br>
You must hurry to <font color="LEVEL">Isael Silvershadow of the Hunter's Village</font>. Help her deal with this matter. We must find Talin's Spear! Our future lies within it!
