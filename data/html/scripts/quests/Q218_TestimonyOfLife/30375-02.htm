Thank you so much, brother of the forest. We have run short of the ink and pens which are used for copying the sacred texts.<br>
To make the ink, we need <font color="LEVEL">Spider Ichor</font>. You can extract it from the <font color="LEVEL">spiders of the Cruma Marshlands</font>. As for the pens, we create them with <font color="LEVEL">Harpy's Down</font>. It would be most helpful if you could bring <font color="LEVEL">20 of each</font>. When you bring me these supplies I shall give you a copy of the book in return.
