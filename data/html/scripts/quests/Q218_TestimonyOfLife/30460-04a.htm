<html><body>Master Cardien:<br>
After you have completed this trial returned a bit more seasoned, I will acknowledge that you are ready to master the higher teachings and will reward you with the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Life</font>.<br> More than any other time in history, we must now truly respect nature, love life and care for our people. Just as the first guardian sacrificed everything, so perhaps will we have to sacrifice many things to overcome the evils of this age.<br>
Even now, Hierarch Asterios is calling young Elves back to the Elven Forest. Behold, your trial has begun! <font color="LEVEL">Take this letter and make haste to your hometown to see the Hierarch.</font> May the stars light your path and bless your journey.<br>
I give you this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
