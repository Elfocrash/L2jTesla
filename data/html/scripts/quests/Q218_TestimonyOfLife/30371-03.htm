<html><body>Thalia:<br>
In the past, we Elves possessed the knowledge to create the holy grail. During the war with Humans the High Artisan Elves who kept the secrets of Mithril and platinum were killed, and the secrets of the grail were lost with them. Therefore we must have the help of other tribes in order to create the grail.<br>
First of all we need to carefully craft a <font color="LEVEL">cup made of Pure Mithril</font>. 'Pure Mithril' is Mithril which contains no other elements but itself, and there are only a few Artisans throughout the continent who can make it.<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Pushkin of the Town of Giran</font>. Although he is a money-grubbing Dwarf who only thinks of money and jewels, he is an outstanding Artisan who knows the techniques of handling Pure Mithril. Take this illustrated book and show it to him. Ask him to make the grail exactly as it appears in the book. He will surely ask a price for that, since he is a Dwarf. Try as much as you can to satisfy his wishes.<br>
I shall be waiting for your return. May the blessings of the starlight be with you.
