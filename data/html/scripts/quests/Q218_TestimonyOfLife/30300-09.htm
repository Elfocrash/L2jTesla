Clang! Clang! Smash with Maphr's hammer! Like smashing her window! Clang! Clang!<br>
Burn it with Pa'agrio's flame! Like sweet nothings to my lover!<br>
Clang! Clang! Dip it in Eva's water! Like drying her tears! Clang! Clang!<br>
Call it with Sylph's wind! Her laughter in my ears! Clang! Clang!<br>
Bright Mithril, you light up the sky! Like love growing in my heart!<br>
Clang! Clang!<br>
