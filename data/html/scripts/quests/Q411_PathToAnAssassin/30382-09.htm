<html><body>Guard Leikan:<br>
As I told you, the thief's identity is an Orc named <font color="LEVEL">Calpico</font>. The fellow is very elusive, so you never know when he will show up or where, but a few days ago a report said that he was seen near the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font> in the Dark Forest. If you search in the vicinity of the School of Dark Arts, you will be able to find the scoundrel's hiding place.
