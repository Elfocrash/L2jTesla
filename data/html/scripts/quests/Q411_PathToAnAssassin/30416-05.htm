Hmm ... So the likes of you wants to change profession to an Assassin? Good. As luck would have it, I was just now in need of a nimble fellow. You must know that the foundation of an Assassin is quick movements! Use this opportunity to prove your skills to me! Now take this and go to <font color="LEVEL">Arkenia at the Dark Elf Altar of Rites. </font><br>
You don't know how to get to the Altar of Rites? Wretched fellow! Go out the east gate of the village and run to the north! Then you will reach the Neutral Zone. There is a bridge to the west that connects to the Dark Forest. After you cross the bridge, follow the road west until you reach the altar.
