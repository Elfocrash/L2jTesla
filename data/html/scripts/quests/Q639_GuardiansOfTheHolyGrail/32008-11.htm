Here you go: one S-grade Enchant Weapon Scroll. Do you like it? You'd better appreciate it; it's a gift from me, after all! Hahaha!<br>
And here are my Scriptures. Once I show Dominic all of the Scriptures, he'll finally appreciate my abilities properly. Of course, he'll think I collected them myself... but in a sense I did, didn't I?
