Very good! Then go to the <font color="LEVEL">Monastery of Silence</font> and defeat its monks. I will give you a reward if you bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Scripture of Monk</font> as proof that you eliminated them.<br>
Oh, yes...one more thing. We have a man on the inside, an agent named <font color="LEVEL">Gremory</font> who infiltrated the Monastery of Silence. He has done brave work, and if you can help him to escape, that would be best. He can be of great assistance to you.
