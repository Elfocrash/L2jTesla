Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font> and <font color="LEVEL">pour a measure of water into the Holy Grail. Then pour the water back into a jar and bring it to me.</font> We can test the water to determine if the Grail is the real thing or not. Be careful when you do this; the room may be guarded.<br>
Oh, another thing. The Room of Splendor is locked, and you'll need a <font color="LEVEL">key to enter it.</font> Some of the monks carry a key to that room; I suggest that you overcome of one of them and take his key.
