Here is the S-grade Enchant Armor Scroll I promised you, then. Do you like it? You'd better appreciate it, fellow; it's a gift from Gremory the spy! Hahaha!<br>
And here are my Scriptures. Once I show Dominic my collection of Scriptures, he'll properly appreciate my abilities. He'll think I collected them myself... but in a sense I did, didn't I?
