I infiltrated this order to find the <font color="LEVEL">Grail of Splendor</font> they keep hidden here in the Monastery of Silence. Now that's a mission for a man! I wouldn't blame you for envying me.<br>
Wait - if you were sent by Dominic, then you report to me now! Hahaha! Yes, I've been expecting this. I have served here so long, so very long... the pressures, you wouldn't understand them. You couldn't. And now he finally recognizes my service and my abilities!<br>
Very well, servant. Your first task will be to massage my shoulders. I'm weary from hiding in this narrow space for so long...<br>
