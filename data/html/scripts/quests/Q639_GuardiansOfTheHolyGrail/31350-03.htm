Well, that's not really important for you to know, is it? I'm sorry, but that's a secret I'm sworn to keep. Suffice it to say that it is something my order needs enough to hire you to get it. Sadly, the monastery is just as intent on keeping it, and their resistance was stronger than we expected. We failed to get it, and so I am here asking you to succeed where we have failed. You will have to defeat them totally; nothing less will allow my order to retrieve what we need from them.<br>
