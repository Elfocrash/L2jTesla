What? Damn it all! I have needed an underling for so long...<br>
Well, never mind that now. Let's talk business. In my searches within the monastery, I have found a <font color="LEVEL">broken bridge</font>. Across the bridge, there is a chamber called the <font color="LEVEL">Room of Splendor</font>.<br>
I don't know what that name means, but... they say the <font color="LEVEL">Holy Grail</font> lies within. That's the place to go.<br>
