Oh well, what do I have to lose? Here is the list of ingredients you will need in order to create a Fairy Stone. Howover this cannot be accomplished easily, not even by a skilled Dwarven Artisan. I do know of a young lady named <font color="LEVEL">Maria who lives in the Town of Dion</font> who can make a Crystal of Purity. I think she may also be able to make a Deluxe Fairy Stone... If she can't help you I am afraid you may be out of luck. But you won't know until you ask, eh? By the way, among the ingredients, the <font color="LEVEL">toad lord's back skin</font> cannot be purchased. You must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font> yourself and kill a <font color="LEVEL">toad lord</font> to collect it.
