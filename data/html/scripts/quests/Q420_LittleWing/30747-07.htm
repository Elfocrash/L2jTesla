Nearby there are drakes and wyverns looking for their lost eggs. There is evil afoot... Why would anyone steal eggs? Really...!<br>
I know of at least five creatures who have had their eggs stolen.<br>
The closest one to us... is <font color="LEVEL">Drake Exarion, who lives at the top of the mountain to the west of Oren Castle</font>. It is a very difficult place for your tribe who cannot fly to reach.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Drake Kalibran lives at the top of another mountain southwest of Oren Castle</font>. Two-legged races like yours typically have quite a bit of trouble climbing mountains, don't they?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Wyvern Suzet is searching in the northwest side of Death Pass</font>, also quite a mountainous region...<br>
And south from there... You will find <font color="LEVEL">Wyvern Shamhai looking for her eggs in the low western mountains of Death Pass</font>.<br>
And last, <font color="LEVEL">Drake Zwov is in the reservoir of the west mountain ridge of Plains of the Lizardmen</font>. You shouldn't have any problem reaching her...<br>
Yes, I hope you can meet up with them. All of them have lost their eggs and are quite frantic. Take this poison of monkshood with you. While deadly to your race it will quickly bring a wyvern or drake to her senses. If you stick it in the nose of one of these creatures, they will gladly do whatever you say. Now go!
