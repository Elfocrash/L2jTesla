This is armor for the hatchling. Would the new mother like to do the honors? OK... The movement of the arms and legs seems good. If it's well fed and cared for it should grow up normally. But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be left unprotected.<br>
I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Take this flute. You'll be able to summon the child at any time just by playing it.<br>
Take heed... If anything should happen to this baby I will cast my strongest curse upon you! Farewell!
