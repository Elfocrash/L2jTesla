<html><body>Pet Manager Cooper:<br>
My, my, hatchlings are very popular this season. I will tell you what I can about them. When they grow larger they are called striders and may be ridden. Later they mature into flying creatures called wyverns. Hatchlings are so cute and cuddly it's hard to imagine that they become such gigantic creatures!<br>
A hatchling will only obey one who possesses a certain degree of skill. You're not yet up to the task.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by players of level 35 and above.)
