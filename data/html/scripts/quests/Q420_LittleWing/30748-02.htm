Gran Kain and Antharas, lord of all scaled four-legged creatures of this land! What an extraordinary meeting! This child of the race of our tormentors agrees to go and recover my children...<br>
Thank you, two-legged creature! As you know, the <font color="LEVEL">leto Lizardman Warriors</font> have stolen my eggs. Those creatures have been seen <font color="LEVEL">near the fortress that you call Oren Castle</font>. There are a <font color="LEVEL">total of 20 eggs</font> that were taken. Kill the lizardmen and bring me my eggs...<br>
Here is one of my scales. The pattern on my eggs will match the pattern on the scale. This will allow you to differentiate my eggs from the eggs of their other victims.
