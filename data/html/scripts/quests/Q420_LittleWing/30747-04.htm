Heh, heh... A Fairy Stone! That's also a white Fairy Stone...! Ha, ha, ha, ha... Haaah. It's great, it's great, it's great! I don't know what it is, but thanks. Thank you so much for giving me this great thing! You're really just a really, super, great guy! I mean, really, really good! I love you! Uh, huh... OK, I'm going to have to give you a gift of gratitude. If Mimyu gets a gift, she always gives a gift in return. OK, take this! It's fairy powder from my wing! It's a mysterious concoction that contributes to the beauty of a woman, the head of a child or the prowess of a man! Well, but that's still not enough, huh? Of course, I'm sure you'll ask for something else. Right? What should I do for you? Huh? Huh? Well, ask me for anything later!<br>
