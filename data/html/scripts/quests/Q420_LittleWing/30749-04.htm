What a waste of time! Look at this! I'm covered with spider bites! I have accomplished nothing for all my troubles! What is that? You succeeded? You found my eggs! Oh, thank you so much! You are a saint!<br>
Let me take a look... One, two, three... They all seem to be in good shape... But what is this, 21? There's one too many! What is going on here? How strange is that? I suppose I laid 21 eggs... No, that can't be right... Well, what's the difference? This one isn't mine, you can have it. If you take it to <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Mimyu</font>, she'll incubate it and make sure that it hatches into a cute baby for you! Please raise it well...!
