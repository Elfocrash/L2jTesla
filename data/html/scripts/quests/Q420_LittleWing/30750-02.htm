Ah yes, you two-legged creatures must always receive payment for your efforts. I understand. My eggs were stolen by <font color="LEVEL">road scavengers</font>. They attacked me and stole my eggs. I have no idea why they would do such a thing. They are camping <font color="LEVEL">near the valley the Humans call the "Death Pass."</font><br>
If you retrieve <font color="LEVEL">all 20 eggs</font> of mine that were stolen, I will do anything within my power that you ask. Here is one of my scales. The pattern of my eggs will match its pattern.
