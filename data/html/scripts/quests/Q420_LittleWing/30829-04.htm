I see that you have not yet gotten a hatchling. Many have bought hatchlings in the market, but I see that you are more of a traditionalist. Ha! Keep trying... Anything worth having is worth working for. If you do get a pet, we'll be glad to care for it in our kennel. It matters not whether it is a hatchling or a wolf.
