Could it be that you are actually here to help me? Ooh... I see you have some Fairy Dust on you! Have you met Fairy Mimyu? In that case I can trust you.<br>
As you may know, my eggs were stolen by spiders and I have no idea why... Recently there have been <font color="LEVEL">many marsh spiders in the Cruma Marshlands</font>... It is a vast area and I fear I will never find my eggs alone. If you will, please go and kill the marsh spiders and recover my offspring. Take my scale so you will recognize the pattern of my eggs. We certainly wouldn't want for you to accidently bring back spider eggs! Please make sure to find all <font color="LEVEL">20 of them</font>! I will continue my search elsewhere. OK?
