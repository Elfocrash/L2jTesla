Hmm, as it is written here? A Fairy Stone?<br>
... It shouldn't be very difficult to make it according to this... I will need you to get the ingredients for me. I don't have any of this stuff just laying around<font color="LEVEL">. Toad Lord Back Skin can be obtained by hunting toad lords near the Cruma Marshlands.</font> You can purchase the other ingredients from adventurers and traders you meet.
