Um...! OK... Yes, I know why you have come looking for me. It's because you want to get a hatchling, right? But that's not such an easy thing. To obtain a hatchling, you've got to get the egg of a wyvern and hatch it. But if it were you and someone asked you for your egg... Ah, your race has live births? Anyway, if someone were to ask you for your child, huh? Would you do it? You wouldn't? You wouldn't? You wouldn't?<br>
Right... But since you gave me a good item, I'll teach you something special... You don't need only a wyvern egg. The egg of anything with scales that flies in the sky is fine. Yeah, creatures like drakes and wyverns... But recently they've been having their own problems and don't really have their wits about them. But, well, you can ask them about it somehow...<br>
