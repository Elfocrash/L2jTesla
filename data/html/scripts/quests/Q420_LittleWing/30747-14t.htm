This is food for the hatchling. This will help the child grow strong. Would the new mother care to do the honors?<br>
OK... The movement of the arms and legs seems to be quite healthy. If it's well fed and cared for it should grow up normally. But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be left unprotected.<br>
I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Take this flute. You'll be able to summon the child at any time just by playing it.<br>
Take heed... If anything should happen to this baby I will cast my strongest curse upon you! Farewell!
