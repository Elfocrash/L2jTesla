You haven't yet found the ones looking for their eggs? Why not? Is it because the mountain was too high? Or perhaps, you forget the locations that I told you? OK, I'll tell you again. Please remember it well!<br>
The closest one to us... is <font color="LEVEL">Drake Exarion, who lives at the top of the mountain to the west of Oren Castle</font>. It is a very difficult place for your tribe who cannot fly to reach.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Drake Kalibran lives at the top of another mountain southwest of Oren Castle</font>. Two-legged races like yours typically have quite a bit of trouble climbing mountains, don't they?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Wyvern Suzet is searching in the northwest side of Death Pass</font>, also quite a mountainous region...<br>
And south from there... You will find <font color="LEVEL">Wyvern Shamhai looking for her eggs in the low western mountains of Death Pass</font>.<br>
And last, <font color="LEVEL">Drake Zwov is in the reservoir of the west mountain ridge of Plains of the Lizardmen</font>. You shouldn't have any problem reaching her...
