<html><body>Drake Kalibran:<br>
Oh my! How could you! No, no way...! Please, anything else! OK... Your kind loves money, don't you? I will do anything to give you as much as you want! No?<br>
How cruel you are! You must be aware that fairies cannot break a promise once made. Sob... I understand. A promise is a promise! You shall have one of my offspring. I beg you to raise my child into a great drake...<br>
The eggs have been weakened by their ordeal and without nurturing the child will die. You must take this egg to <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Mimyu</font>, she will know what to do. Please hurry!
