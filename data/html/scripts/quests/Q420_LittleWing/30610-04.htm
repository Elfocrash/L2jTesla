<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br>
Are you deaf? You still insist on going there even though you will surely be killed? Oh well, you were warned! Don't blame me if you wind up dead.<br>
Now where is that book?<br>
You must listen carefully! Let's assume that by some miracle you survive the Enchanted Valley long enough to meet a fairy. Do you really think this fairy will listen to you and grant your request? Certainly not! The fairy will ignore you, not even bothering to laugh at your ignorance. If you wish to catch a fairy's eye you must have a <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Stone</font>! You cannot buy one anywhere. You must collect the ingredients and make it yourself!<br>
There are two types of Fairy Stone. One is a regular Fairy Stone and the other is a <font color="LEVEL">Deluxe Fairy Stone</font>. The difference between them is quite mysterious, even for a wizened old sage like myself.<br>
