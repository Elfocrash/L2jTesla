<html><body>Guard Byron:<br>
You haven't left for Enchanted Valley yet? If you wish to meet a Fairy, you must take the pure white Fairy Stone and go to the <font color="LEVEL">very deepest part of the northern valley</font>. If you're lucky, you will meet a Fairy there. But you must be careful. If the blood of any creature living in Enchanted Valley should get on the pure white Fairy Stone, it will break. Therefore, you <font color="LEVEL">must not fight</font>.
