If you were irresponsible I know you wouldn't have been able speak with Fairy Mimyu and find me like this. In the name of Sayha and Antharas, if you recover <font color="LEVEL">my 20 lost eggs</font> that have been stolen by Breka orcs, I promise to give one of them to you. Take my scale with you. My eggs will have the same pattern as this scale so you can recognize them. You must stalk and kill the <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orc overlords</font>. Many of them can be found in a place the Humans call <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> in the northern part of the land.
