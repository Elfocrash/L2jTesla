Oh, my eggs, my precious eggs...! Have you found all of them? Yes! Everyone is still healthy! Thank you for your hard work. You can go now...<br>
Oh yes, the matter of my egg. I doubt whether you can raise my baby to be strong and brave, cruel and proud. I will test you to find out. Take this egg to <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Mimyu</font> and ask her to hatch it for you. Take good care of my child. If you neglect or mistreat my little one, I shall feed you to it! Understand?
