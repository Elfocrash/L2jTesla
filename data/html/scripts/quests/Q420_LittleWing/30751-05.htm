You saved all my eggs! And none damaged! Outstanding! Dear Sayha, thank you.<br>
Of course I guess I should give you the reward... As I promised, I will give you one of my eggs. If you take it to <font color="LEVEL">Fairy Mimyu</font>, she will hatch it for you. During the upcoming time of war and tribulation, I pray that my child will demonstrate his valor alongside you!
