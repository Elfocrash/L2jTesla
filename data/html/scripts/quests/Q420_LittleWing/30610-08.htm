Are you kidding? You made a Fairy Stone? Seriously? I didn't expect it to work! May I see it? Oh my, it is splendid! Consider how lucky you are, my young friend. A wizened old sage like myself never expected to see one with my own eyes. I wonder what you should do next?<br>
Oh yes, I know! You have met <font color="LEVEL">Byron, the guard of this village</font>... He is from here, and seems to know more than anyone about the creatures in this place. He will tell you what to do next.
