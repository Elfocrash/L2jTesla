Why are you dawdling about? Don't you have your instructions? If you do not create the stone, I'll have nothing more to do with you! You must go see <font color="LEVEL">Maria at the Town of Dion</font>, she will tell you more. To find the <font color="LEVEL">toad lord's back skin</font> you must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font> yourself and capture a <font color="LEVEL">toad lord</font>.
