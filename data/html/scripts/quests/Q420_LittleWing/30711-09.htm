Weren't you off to meet a Fairy? What happened?! Looks like you had some trouble in the valley. Did you lose the pure white Fairy Stone? Oh, what a shame...<br>
If you still wish to meet a Fairy, then you must make another Fairy Stone. Did <font color="LEVEL">Elder Cronos</font> help you with the last one? You must go back and ask him again.
