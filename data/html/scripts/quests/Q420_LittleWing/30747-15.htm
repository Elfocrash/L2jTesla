Shall we begin?<br>
OK.... It's moving. Good job...<br>
Alright! There's the weak spot. Together now... One, two, three..! Once more... One! Two! Three!<br>
There's a crack... Alright, now come out under your own power! Here is your mother, little one... She who will feed you and teach you many things!<br>
OK, now all the way out!<br>
OK... Good job! Thank you!<br>
Yes, the movement of the arms and legs seems normal... If it's well fed and cared for it should grow up normally. But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be left unprotected.<br>
I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Take this flute. You'll be able to summon the child at any time just by playing it.<br>
Take heed... If anything should happen to this baby I will cast my strongest curse upon you! Farewell!
