You are a mean, greedy and selfish creature! What harm would it do to part with a little of the dust I gave you?<br>
Oh well, it seems to be moving normally. If it's well fed and cared for it should thrive. But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be left unprotected.<br>
I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Take this flute. You'll be able to summon the child at any time just by blowing on it.<br>
Take heed... If anything should happen to this baby I will cast my strongest curse upon you! Farewell!
