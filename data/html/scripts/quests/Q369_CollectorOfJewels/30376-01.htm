<html><body>Magister Nell:<br>
Do you wish to hear my story? Once I met a Wiseman. He convinced me that the Forgotten Temple is related to the Ruins on Talking Island.<br>
This glittering Flare Shard and Freezing Shard are proof! They are fragments from the Ruins of Talking Island and the Forgotten Temple! Before they were broken, these two elemental stones had mutual resonance. I'm sure of it! I'm desperate to get my hands on more of these fragments... If you know anyone strong enough to enter the Forgotten Temple and bring me some of these stones, please ask them to come and see me at once!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 25 and above.)
