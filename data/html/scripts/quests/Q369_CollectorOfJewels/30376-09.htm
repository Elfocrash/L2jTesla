Ah, what a profile! Like a classic statue... And that voice! Like an arrow piercing my heart...Where is he now? I wonder what he's doing?<br>
I must give him some Spirit Ore! Please, bring me <font color="LEVEL">200 Flare Shards and 200 Freezing Shards</font>!<br>
You can get them from Salamanders, Undines, Death Fires and Roxides, deep within the Forgotten Temple! Please, hurry! Time is short!
