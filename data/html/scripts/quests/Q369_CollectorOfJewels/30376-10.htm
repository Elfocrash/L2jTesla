Amazing! You've brought them! They must have been very heavy! Please put them down here. Be very, very careful!<br>
Thank you for your hard work. Here is your reward. These fragments are kind of small. Now, I can meet Les with confidence. He contacted me some time ago...<br>
Anyway, thank you for your help. If possible, please come and help me again sometime, and bring some friends to help you! Take care!
