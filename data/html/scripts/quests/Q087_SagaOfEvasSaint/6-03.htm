<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Painful thoughts... thoughts that you don't understand creep into the back of your mind... You look toward a bright light and teh pain slowly subsides. You see the next Tablet. It seems to be in <font color="LEVEL">the southeastern outpost of the Ketra Orc</font>. But there seems to be someone else holding the Resonance Amulet. He looks like Von Haures who you know from a book. You try to look closely at him, but the vision fades. You feel compelled to discover the truth! Go to the next Tablet in <font color="LEVEL">the southeastern outpost of the Ketra Orc</font>.</body></html>
