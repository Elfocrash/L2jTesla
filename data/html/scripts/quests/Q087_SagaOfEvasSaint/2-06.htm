 Many, many thanks! I will put this food in the warehouse and give it to people at dinner time and from there, lead them to the Path of Light. Thanks to your help, I can now give happiness to these people. Your noble sacrifice will not be forgotten.<br>
 Actually, if I recall, you came to me for the way to go on. Before you, someone called <font color="LEVEL">Elikia</font> came to me to talk as well. It appears that you both are walking through similar paths. So I will share with you what I shared with <font color="LEVEL">Elikia</font>.<br>
 This is the Resonance Amulet. I heard if you bring this to the Tablet of Vision, you will get additional knowledge. To visit the Tablet of Vision with this stone, go to <font color="LEVEL">the south of the Tower of Insolence</font>.</body></html>
