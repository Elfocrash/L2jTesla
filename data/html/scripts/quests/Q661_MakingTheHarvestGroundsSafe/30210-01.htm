<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
We of the Iron Gate Guild are currently participating in various reconstruction works to restore Gludio Territory from the devastation of war...<br>
We've obtained permission from the Lord to start a construction project in this area.<br>
We've been having problems with monsters rampaging through the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds that produce our construction materials, so we're not making much progress...<br>
Other factors have led to a shortage of resources in the manor. The Lord is seeking adventurers to help us solve this problem...<br>
Will you help us rebuild Gludio Territory?<br>
