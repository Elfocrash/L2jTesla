Thank you so much. First, take this letter. Show it to <font color="LEVEL">Thalia</font> and she will know that I sent you. Get the Mother Tree fruit from her and bring it back to me. Please hurry, as the fruit may spoil. We cannot make nectar from spoiled fruit.<br>
Just follow the southern path from the village to reach Lake Iris. My sister Thalia lives in the small observatory on the eastern lake shore.<br>
Thank you in advance and please send her my regards.
