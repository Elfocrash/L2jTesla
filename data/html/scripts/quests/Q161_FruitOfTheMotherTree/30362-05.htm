Oh, you haven't left yet. Take my letter to my sister Thalia and bring back the Mother Tree fruit. Follow the southern path from the village to reach Lake Iris. My sister Thalia lives in the small observatory around the lake on the eastern shore.<br>
Please hurry, as the fruit may spoil. Thank you.
