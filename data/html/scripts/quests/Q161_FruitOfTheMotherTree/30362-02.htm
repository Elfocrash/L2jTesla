My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the young Mother Trees in the forest. This task lets us see the changes to the Mother Trees and the Elven woods in all four seasons, and we find it a delightful task. The nectar that gives we children of the forest our nearly eternal lives is made from the <font color="LEVEL">fruit of the Mother Tree</font>.<br>
Fruit harvests have been gradually decreasing lately, and I think it is because of the spores that spread to our woods from the Sea of Spores on the other side of the mountain. At this rate, we may not be able to make nectar anymore.<br>
My sister Thalia is the protector of the Mother Tree near Lake Iris, and has said that the Mother Tree there may soon bear fruit. Do you think you could go and get the fruit from her when it is ready?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven character of level 3 and above.)
