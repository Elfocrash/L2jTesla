Be patient my young friend! I shall create a marvelous weapon for you, one that will make the earth tremble!<br>
Clang! Clang! Behold the power of the hammer of Maphr! Clang! Clang!<br>
Boom! Boom! Forged in the flames of Pa'agrio! Clang! Clang!<br>
Bang bang! Immersed in the water of Eva! Clang! Clang! Splash!<br>
Bang! Bang! Cooled with the wind of Sayha! I hear her laughing in my ear! Bang! Bang!<br>
Clang! Clang! The flames of passion heat the metal to the core! Such is the love in my heart! Clang! Clang!<br>
...Voila! It is finished! Not to toot my own horn, but I'm one of only a handful of Dwarves capable of creating A grade weapons on this continent! I, Maestro Reorin, present you with this <font color="LEVEL">%weaponname%</font>! Also, take this mark engraved with the Phoenix of Revolution or the Messenger of Dawn. The mysterious woman who foretold your coming asked me to give it to you...<br>
I suppose our time together is over. Thank you for your help. If you see that mysterious woman again, give her my regards!
