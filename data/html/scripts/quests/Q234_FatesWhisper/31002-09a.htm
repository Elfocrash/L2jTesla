Don't get upset, it's just one more little thing. Before the metal cools I must add some B grade crystals. If I apply this formula to the mass of the metal and allow for its its tensile strength... I have determined that I will need exactly <font color="LEVEL">984 B grade crystals</font>. Please bring them to me immediately!
