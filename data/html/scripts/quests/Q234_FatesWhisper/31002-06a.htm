My former apprentice <font color="LEVEL">Cliff</font> should have some. I must admit, I cannot bear to look him in the face. Through my darkest days, Cliff stuck by me. He only left after I became drunk and physically threw him out...<br>
Please go see Cliff and obtain the Infernium Varnish. He is now a <font color="LEVEL">warehouse keeper</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Oren Castle Town</font>. I am counting on you, my friend!
