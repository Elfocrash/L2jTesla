<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
Did you forget what I had asked you to do? <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate</font> leads the army of darkness. He is also known as the insolent invader and the archenemy of the angels. He plans to invade the Tower of Insolence and steal the ancient treasure that is on its highest floor. <font color="LEVEL">Longhorn General Golkonda</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Kernon</font> are assisting him. All three of these demons are carrying infernium scepters!<br>
Please go and retrieve these scepters and bring them to me so that I may destroy them!
