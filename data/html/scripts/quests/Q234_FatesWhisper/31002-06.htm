Is it true? Have you really slain Death Lord Hallate and his underlings...? Indeed, the mysterious woman was telling the truth.<br>
Yes, the infernium scepters... My greatest masterpiece and the key to my downfall... Now, I will gladly destroy them and create an even more powerful weapon for you!<br>
Do you smell that? It's the infernium. Smells like Sulfur, doesn't it? That's why the demons are so fond of it. An amazing material, really. Tougher and lighter than mithril, it is one of the finest materials you will find. It can be used to make Grade A weapon that you will find most useful. Refining this material can be tricky, however. I will need some <font color="LEVEL">Infernium Varnish</font>. It is quite rare.<br>
