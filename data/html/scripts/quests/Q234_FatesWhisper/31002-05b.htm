Ah, yes, <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate</font>... He leads the army of darkness. He is also known as the insolent invader and the archenemy of the angels. He plans to invade the Tower of Insolence and steal the ancient treasure that is on its highest floor. <font color="LEVEL">Longhorn General Golkonda</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Kernon</font> are assisting him. All three of these demons are carrying infernium scepters!<br>
Legend says that angels protected the tower with a powerful force field, shielding it from all with evil intent. However, using the scepter I made for him, Hallate has breached the shield. To think of the hours I spent toiling over that scepter, putting my heart and soul into it, and now it's come to this...
