<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
Those wicked demons forced me to make an <font color="LEVEL">infernium scepter</font>. Infernium is a very rare element, seldom seen since the time of the Titans. They told me that I should be honored to be working with such a precious material. I must admit that this thought appealed to me, and I quickly set about creating the scepters for them.<br>
Now it is clear what I must do. I must recover the three scepters and melt them away so that they cannot be used by the demons. This will restore my honor! To do this, I will have to confront <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate and his minions</font>! I will not be successful without your help. Please, help me do this!<br>
