Maestro Reorin's Mold? Yes, I bought it from him a year ago. I got a great deal on it. Actually, since it was a tool used by such a famous artisan, I was ready to pay considerably more for it. When I saw how cheaply he had it priced, I snatched it right up.<br>
As soon as I gave him the adena Maestro Reorin ran to a liquor store. I hated to see him like that. He was so well-respected at one time...<br>
