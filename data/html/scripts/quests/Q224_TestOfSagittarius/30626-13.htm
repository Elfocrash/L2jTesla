<html><body>Sagittarius Hamil:<br>
So you haven't found Brankel... He is searching for the heathens? He is noble indeed. He was correct, they must be up to something else. <font color="LEVEL">Commander Kadesh</font> is not their final goal...<br>
This amulet holds clues for us... The seven eyes... This is the mark of the children of Shilen. I must report this to the hunter's union immediately. I will also return the crescent bow to the Ivory Tower of Oren.<br>
Thank you for your help. You have done more in this matter than Brankel or myself...<br>
You are a Sagittarius. Take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Sagittarius</font>. I hope that we shall hunt together sometime in the future.
