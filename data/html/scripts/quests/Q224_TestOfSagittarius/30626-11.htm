Brankel lives! I met with him shortly before he left for the south of Oren.<font color="LEVEL"> Commander Kadesh</font> is currently surviving off the flesh of Leto Lizardmen.<br>
Dammit! I should've gone with Brankel!<br>
Oh! Look! The crescent bow! I haven't seen it in 20 years! Take it and follow Brankel! Kill the <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardmen</font> and Kadesh will appear! Kill him with the crescent bow!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">You mustn't use any other method or skill, or the power of the bow will disappear and Kadesh will survive</font>!
