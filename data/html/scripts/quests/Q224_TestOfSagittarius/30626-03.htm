I will read the letter to you:<br>
I am leaving now for the Ant's Nest and I'm not sure if I shall return... I will try to leave clues for you to follow me. Please hurry, brother.<br>
Brankel<br>
...I wish I could follow him right away, but I am busy defending the village from the Leto Lizardmen... Dammit!<br>
Please go to the Wastelands and try to find Brankel. If you are unable to find him, look for the traces he said he would leave. The wastelands guardian <font color="LEVEL">Aron Tanford</font> is expecting you at the <font color="LEVEL">southern entrance of the Wastelands</font>.<br>
You must leave now!
