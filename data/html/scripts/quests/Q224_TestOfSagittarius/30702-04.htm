Hmm... All right, you may try. First go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Hamil of Floran Village</font>. He is originally from Innadril. He is a genius of archery, who received the title of Sagittarius at the age of 20. He has instructed many archers twice his age!<br>
Ha! To tell you the truth, it is more important for you to win Hamil's approval rather than mine for the test. Take this Letter of Introduction to him. Hamil will have a task for you. Perform it well, young one. May the joy of the chase and the reward of the hunt be with you!
