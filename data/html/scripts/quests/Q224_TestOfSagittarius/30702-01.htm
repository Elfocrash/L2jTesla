<html><body>Guild President Bernard:<br>
Sagittarians are those who are known as the best bowmen of this kingdom. A hundred years ago, when the dragon Lindvior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman named Atlanta shot an arrow right through the dragon's eye. For this he was given the first title as a Sagittarius. Right now there are just 33 Sagittarians in the world.<br>
If you want to be recognized as an exemplary bowman, you may take the <font color="LEVEL">Test of Sagittarius</font> and prove your ability. Many hunters and bowmen have taken the test this year and failed. You must be well above average to pass this test... I heard that you are skillful but as I see it, from the perpective of a Guild President... You are not good enough. Train some more before you come back.<br>
