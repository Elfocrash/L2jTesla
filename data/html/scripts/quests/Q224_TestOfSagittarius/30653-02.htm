<html><body>Sir Aron Tanford:<br>
About 10 days ago, two travelers entered the Wastelands claiming they had come to excavate artifacts of the empirical era. Although I doubted their story I didn't stop them. When I spoke with Hunter Brankel a few days later, I realized that I had made a grave mistake. They were not archaeologists, but a bunch of ravenous heathens!<br>
As you know, the castle of the evil Beleth once stood where the Wastelands are now. I am sure these heathens seek the remains of that devil! Brankel went to the <font color="LEVEL">Ant's Nest of the Wastelands</font> to try to determine their motives. I haven't heard from him since...<br>
I am sorry but this is all I know.
