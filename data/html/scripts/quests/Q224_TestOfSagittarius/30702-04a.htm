Hmmm . . . well, go ahead and try. My advice is to first visit <font color="LEVEL">Hamil from Floran Village</font>. He is a native of Innadril and an amazing archer -- he earned the nickname Sagittarius before he was even out of his teens. In fact, much more experienced archers even used to come to him for training.<br>
To pass this test, you must impress Hamil. Take this introduction letter to him and he will tell you what task to perform. Good luck, youngster. May the joy of the hunt be with you!<br>
Before you set off, accept this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it for something special from the village gatekeeper. I'm sure it prove helpful to you on your journey.
