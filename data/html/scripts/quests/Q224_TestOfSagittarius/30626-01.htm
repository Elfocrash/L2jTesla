Nice to meet you, young Warrior. Did Bernard send you here? We are in need of help. Your arrival is most timely.<br>
There is evil afoot in the southern part of the kingdom. The wasteland ants are on the move, and from the east, the Breka Orcs are restive... On top of all this, something weird is happening at the Cruma Tower. The Dwarves are all aflutter about it... Something has awoken beneath the tower...<br>
I have the feeling that our troubles have just begun... I believe there is more to come, something even bigger.... If only we could find Brankel, we would have more precise information...<br>
