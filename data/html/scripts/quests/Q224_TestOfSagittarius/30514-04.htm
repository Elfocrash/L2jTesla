This amulet will summon the spirits of the totem! Could those filthy Breka Orcs be trying to revive their long-dead totem spirit?<br>
Those foolish pigs have been deceived by the heathens into believing that hatching the devil serpent will restore the spirit of their totem!<br>
I know that Brankel would not have gone along with this. Could these runes be a message from him? I can't read this, but Hamil knows it well. Take it to him. I wish you luck!
