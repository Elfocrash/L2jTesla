Here is <font color="LEVEL">the Crescent Bow</font>. This bow is different from other bows, as there is magic in it designed to kill Commander Kadesh. Keep in mind that you can only shoot a <font color="LEVEL">Wooden Arrow</font> with this bow.<br>
You must kill Commander Kadesh with the Crescent Bow. Right now he is still somewhat weak but as time goes by he will grow stronger and cause more damage. First you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Hamil</font> and find out where Commander Kadesh is located.<br>
Go now. The Ivory Tower wishes you victory.
