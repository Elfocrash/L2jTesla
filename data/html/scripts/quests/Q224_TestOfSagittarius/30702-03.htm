<html><body>Guild President Bernard:<br>
Sagittarians are those who are known as the best bowmen in this kingdom. A hundred years ago, when the Gold Dragon Lindvior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman by the name of Atlanta shot an arrow right through the dragon's eye. For this he was given the first title as a Sagittarius. At the moment there are just 33 Sagittarians in the world.<br>
If you wish to be recognized as an exemplary bowman, you may take the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Sagittarius</font> and prove your ability. Many hunters and bowmen took the test this year, and all failed. I warn you, if your skills are not good enough to shoot down a flying eagle, you might as well not even try.<br>
