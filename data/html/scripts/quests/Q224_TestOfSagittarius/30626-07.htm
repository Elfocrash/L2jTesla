Those heathen followers of the Goddess of Destruction. Or should I say 'The children of Shilen'... Bah!<br>
I am sure that race is behind the mischief that has been going on lately!<br>
You must hurry and go to Giran! If what Brankel says is true, the Breka Orcs are having the black egg delivered to them! Are these the only runes you found? There are likely more of them so keep searching.<br>
You should go to <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Giran</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Vokian</font>. He owes me a favor, and will certainly help. Some things only an Orc can do. Ask him about the Breka Orcs.
