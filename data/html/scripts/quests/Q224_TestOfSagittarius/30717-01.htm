<html><body>Magister Gauen:<br>
I am Magister Gauen. Ah, yes, Commander Kadesh and the Crescent Bow... That is a story that I'll never forget. Commander Kadesh is the most daring among all the sons of Shilen. He eats like a horse, yet he is always hungry! He is constantly growing... This caused anxiety among the Gods, and they gave instructions to the Elves on how to kill him with <font color="LEVEL">the Crescent Bow</font>. This bow was kept in the Ivory Tower for a long time, and 20 years ago became useless...<br>
...but if what you are saying is true, we need the bow...<br>
I can restore the bow, but it will not be easy. Most of the materials I will need you can find in the Ivory Tower, but some you'll have to find elsewhere... <font color="LEVEL">A horn from a manashen gargoyle</font>, <font color="LEVEL">a Reinforced Bowstring</font> made of <font color="LEVEL">the swamp spider's web</font>, <font color="LEVEL">a Mithril Ring</font> which can be obtained from a <font color="LEVEL">road scavenger</font> and <font color="LEVEL">a chitin of a swamp stakato</font> which can be obtained from a <font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stakato worker, a Marsh Stakato soldier, or a Marsh Stakato drone</font>.
