What are you still doing here? Where is the <font color="LEVEL">enchanted iron</font> you said you'd bring me? Remember? Find the <font color="LEVEL">enchanted iron golem</font> in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower, peel off some of its skin and bring it to me! I'll need <font color="LEVEL">five</font> pieces. That golem is a sturdy fellow, you'll really need to use all your strength!
