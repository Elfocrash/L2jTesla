I need some <font color="LEVEL">enchanted iron</font>. It's made by applying magic to Iron Ore. There aren't any Mystics around, so we'll have to improvise... A creature known as the <font color="LEVEL">enchanted iron golem</font> can be found in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower. Peel off some of its scrap and bring it to me! I'll need about <font color="LEVEL">five</font> pieces. These golems are quite durable, and won't peel away easily. Give it all you've got!
