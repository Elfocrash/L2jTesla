<html><body>Maryse Redbonnet:<br>
When I was 10, I decided to kill all the wolves in the world, because they killed my loving family. I didn't want this to happen to others, you see. That's why I became a wolf hunter... I still vividly remember my first kill... It was a wolf cub that was only a few days old... I killed it without mercy.<br>
After that, I killed every wolf that I saw! I killed hundreds, no, thousands of wolves! People saw me carrying a bundle of Wolf Pelts and called me the <font color="LEVEL">Redbonnet the horrible.</font> I must kill wolves! I have to kill them all!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 4 and above.)
