Very well, then. Listen carefully! Go to the Altar of Saints, sprinkle this Blood of Saint on it and then come back. You may think that this sounds simple... But I warn you... Unless your faith in us is very strong, you won't complete this mission!<br>
So go sprinkle the blood on the Altar of Saints! You can see it from the path by the entrance to the Valley of Saints. Don't get lost on your way there! May Triol watch over you...
