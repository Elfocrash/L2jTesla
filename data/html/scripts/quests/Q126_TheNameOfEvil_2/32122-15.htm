<html><body>Warrior's Grave:<br>
What you have seen are signs of Sailren's awakening, throwing off the power of the seal! Sailren is filled with wickedness and death, and has the ability to influence the thoughts and actions of others -- even possess their spirits! It was that ability that led many Elrokian warriors to an ignoble death while I lived.<br>
Unless this awakening is prevented, the entire island will succumb to the chaos.<br>
There is no time to waste -- you must listen to me and heed my words. Only you can save my people!<br>
