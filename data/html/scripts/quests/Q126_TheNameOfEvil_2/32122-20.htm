Have you not heard that ancient song, with its sweet but sorrowful melody?<br>
You know so much about the Elroki tribe -- I cannot believe no one has taught it to you.<br>
Search your memory! If you truly do not know it, you must search out someone who can teach it to you; sadly, I am prohibited from helping you learn it.
