Yes, it is true. There will be great danger, but if you face Sailren while wielding Gazkh, you will weaken the creature's power. Then we stone statues may gather all our power and seal him again in his prison. But to wield Gazkh, you must take the Warrior's Oath, which can be made only by an Elrokian who has undergone a difficult rite of passage. The spirit of that warrior's grave gave you his ashes so that you might satisfy the conditions of the oath by giving them to me. In doing so, you will become one with the Elrokian warrior. Are you ready to take the Warrior's Oath?<br>
