Here is the wisdom that you seek.<br>
Outsider of fate, Shilen's will is that you now travel to the <font color="LEVEL">Warrior's Grave</font> and pray over it with a true heart. Then you will receive what you require.<br>
The grave lies at <font color="LEVEL">the end of the southwest</font> area. Take this fragment of Gazkh that you showed me, whose memories have revealed this wisdom to me.<br>
If only you could restore the fragment to its rightful master!
