<html><body>Warrior's Grave:<br>
The seal stone is the most powerful of its kind in the Lost Nest, keeping both man and dinosaur apart from each other.<br>
It will likely possess some sort of unique shape; I doubt you will have trouble recognizing it when you see it.<br>
Deposit my ashes on the stone and you will learn how to wield Gazkh. The seal stone may also have other information we need to stop Sailren from destroying the island.<br>
Time is fleeting! Hurry and find the seal stone before its protective power fails entirely!
