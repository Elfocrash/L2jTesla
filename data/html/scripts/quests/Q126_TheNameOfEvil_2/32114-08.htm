Time is now urgent; we do not know when Sailren's violence will begin to spread further. If I interpret this correctly, the fragments of Gazkh are embedded in the bodies of several of the predatory dinosaurs.<br>
To find out more, you must communicate with Shilen's stone statue, the gatekeeper of Sailren's nest. Go to the statue, tell it the hidden meaning of the password and ask about the location of the predatory dinosaurs.<br>
Do not be surprised if your news shocks the statue; this is something none of us considered. The statue stands at the <font color="LEVEL">southeast end of the Lost Nest</font>. You have been there before, haven't you?<br>
