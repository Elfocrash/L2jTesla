Let us not risk that my suspicions are clouding your judgment! I will let you draw your own conclusions. This will be an arduous task, but my heart tells me that the best course of action is for you to return to the Pillars of Wisdom, one by one, and search for some clue about the strange phenomena happening on this island.<br>
Carefully examine each of the Pillars. If you discover any useful information, please return to me.<br>
Proof of what you find would be even more welcome! I will wait here for you -- may your eyes be sharp and your sword arm strong for the journey!
