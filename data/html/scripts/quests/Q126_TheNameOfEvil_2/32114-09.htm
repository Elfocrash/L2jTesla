Ah, my spirit rejoices to hear you say that you will help us! In truth, this will not be an easy task. The fate of the Elroki tribe is in your hands, my friend.<br>
But fear not! You are the warrior chosen by Shilen for this purpose. Not only will Shilen lead you to Gazkh, she will fight by your side until the final day! She will guard and guide you, just as she did my ancestors.<br>
Here, take this. It will aid you on your journey. May Shilen be with you?
