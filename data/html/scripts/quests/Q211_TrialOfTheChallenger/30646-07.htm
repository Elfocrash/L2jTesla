<html><body>Champion Raldo:<br>
That chick is the leader, I think. Don't bother with the small fry, that's my motto! Oh, don't worry about my friends. They're off guarding other places, and honestly they'd dust the floor with you, anyway. But hey, no hard feelings, right? You were a big help in protecting this place, and no one can say that Champion Raldo doesn't know how to repay bravery when he sees it.<br>
Here, take this! It's a gift for your efforts. In fact, it's the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Challenger</font>, the one you were looking for. Well, enough talk -- I'd best get out there and slay them all before they get away. Excelsior!
