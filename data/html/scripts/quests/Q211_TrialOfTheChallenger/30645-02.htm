Let's see then, what would be appropriate...? Ah, yes! There is <font color="LEVEL">an evil creature attacking the villagers of Floran</font> in recent days. He has been called <font color="LEVEL">'Gorr'</font>. He lives in a <font color="LEVEL">cave near Floran</font> and attacks innocent villagers at random.<br>
Go and kill this evil creature. "The hero who saved a village"... Doesn't this sound like someone who might carry such a mark?
