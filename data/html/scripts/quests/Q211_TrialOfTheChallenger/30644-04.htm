Are you familiar with the Neutral Zone between the lands of the Elves and the Dark Elves? <font color="LEVEL">Shyslyssys</font>, an ancient medusa, makes her home there. Of course, these stories always include an extraordinary amount of treasure. You must go to her cave and kill everyone there. You may keep all the treasure you find, all I ask is that you bring back any <font color="LEVEL">old parchment</font> that is there. Will you accept?<br>
