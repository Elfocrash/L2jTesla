We accidently found out where the lost Guild members might be! They were turned into ice sculptures! Do you think you could go and see if there are any remnants of their investigation? You can find the ice sculptures on the <font color="LEVEL">plains north of the entrance of the Ice Queen's castle</font>. Please, help us!
