Good! Find Trader Helmut at the weapons and armor shop. He'll give you the details. Basically, you're delivering goods to them. It won't be very difficult. After the delivery, the next step is up to you. It depends entirely on how you act as to whether you gain their trust or become their enemy. Good luck!
