<html><body>Guard Rath:<br>
Destroy the lizardmen and take their bracelets as proof of your victory.<br>
Kill the <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardmen, Leto Lizardman Archers, Leto Lizardman Soldiers, Leto Lizardman Overlords', Leto Lizardman Warriors</font> and so on. Don't attack their shaman! It might cause them to stop the ritual before our investigation is complete. The ritual must not end until our investigation is complete!<br>
The guild had already sent me a reward for 60 bracelets. I'll give it to you as soon as you earn it.
