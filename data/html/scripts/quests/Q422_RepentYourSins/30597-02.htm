I'm beginning to think that those damned <font color="LEVEL">Turek war hounds</font> are worse that the Turek orcs themselves. Not long ago I was attacked by one and nearly lost my leg! Please go and hunt 10 of them down at the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Barracks</font>.<br>
You don't need to bring those filthy animals' corpses back here, just cut off their tails to prove how many you've killed.
