Very well, the test can begin. You must go and see <font color="LEVEL">Katari</font>, a Dark Elf. She teaches the word of Einhasad to godless heathens, such as the ol mahums... She needs your help.<br>
Meet her at the <font color="LEVEL">edge of the Dark Elven Forest north of the Marshland</font> and offer her your help. Come back to see us after you complete this task.
