This is the first time that <font color="LEVEL">Wiseman Casian</font> has ever met with a black judge. He has volunteered to walk the path of endless hardship. Right now he is working on a task in <font color="LEVEL">the southern Wasteland in Gludio</font>. He is in trouble and needs some help... Go there and find him. Come back and see us when you have completed the task.<br>
