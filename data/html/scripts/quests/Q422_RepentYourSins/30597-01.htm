Are you here to hunt the <font color="LEVEL">Turek war hounds</font>? A while back a black-clad sage appeared and told me that someone like you was coming and I should ask for help with my needs.<br>
When the war was over I returned to find my farm devastated by the filthy orcs! I hired mercenaries and managed to drive them off my land, but their cursed stray war hounds remain and are rampaging and killing my cattle. Recently they have even been threatening the farmers.<br>
If you are here to help, please kill the <font color="LEVEL">Turek war hounds</font>. Please kill at least 10 of them! Of course they can be found near the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Barracks</font>!
