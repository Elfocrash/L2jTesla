<html><body>Katari:<br>
At last! You have come for me! Oh, pardon me... I had a very vivid dream last night, and I've been waiting for someone like you to come for me. Just in case you were the one in my dreams, I wanted you to know. Well... then, I may as well ask you.<br>
I and some religious ol mahums are being threatened by <font color="LEVEL">scavenger wererats</font>. They seem to be unaware of the teachings of the god of light. Everyone knows, even after a conversion, ol mahums are not to be trifled with. The same can be said of the Dark Elves. Our god of light is no coward, and I'm ready to teach them a thing or two.<br>
Please, would you go kill these creatures? Bring back 10 <font color="LEVEL">skulls of scavenger wererats</font>. They can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Neutral Zone</font>. Put a good scare into them, something to let them know they shouldn't pick on missionaries.
