Manacles of a Penitent...? Ah yes. A strange item, but I can make them. Funny thing, too... I've been getting a lot of orders for these lately. They must be getting popular... In fact, so popular that I've run out of the ingredients I need to make them!<br>
Would you mind going and getting the ingredients listed on this recipe? I will make the manacles for you if you do this.
