<html><body>Sage Casian:<br>
Why would you want to help me? Someone up there must like me. Things keep happening that give me the impression that my penance is being watched over.<br>
So, will you do me a favor? I am researching different ways that this polluted Wasteland can be restored to its previous, verdant state. The most promising method is a potion I've been working on. To make this potion I must secure the heart of a <font color="LEVEL">tyrant kingpin</font>. This could very well be above your abilities, but if you bring me the <font color="LEVEL">heart of a tyrant kingpin</font> my research can continue. You will find the beasts in the <font color="LEVEL">western part of the Wasteland</font>.
