Oh! You have collected all the jewels! Now we can begin the ritual.<br>
Water is the source of life. Mother, and eternity. Cleanse our stained souls with the Tears of Eva, purer than anything in the world, and give us your new blessing...<br>
With this, you have performed the ritual and earned the qualifications to become an Elven Wizard. Here, take this <font color="LEVEL">Eternity Diamond.</font> If you take this to <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Raymond in Gludio Castle Town,</font> he will change your occupation to Elven Wizard. Of course, you can go to <font color="LEVEL">High Priestess Levian in Gludin</font> as well.
