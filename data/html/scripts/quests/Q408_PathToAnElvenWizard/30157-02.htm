I knew you would help me. The Magical Powers Ruby contains a fiery force, and it is a precious material for those who study Elemental Magic. Our family has been producing Mystics for generations, and we all benefit from these stones.<br>
I would like to make more of these rubies, but I am short on one material component. I need a certain component that can be found on the necks of the Pincer Spider. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Red Down</font>.<br>
Hunt Pincer Spiders and bring back five clumps of Red Down. I will then create a Magical Powers Ruby for you. Here... let me give you this. It is a talisman that I carry around for protection... It may be of some help to you.
