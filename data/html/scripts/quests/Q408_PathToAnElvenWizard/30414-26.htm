You have collected <font color="LEVEL">five Gold Leaves</font> with no difficulty, I see. There was a time when the Elven Forest was full of these leaves... Now they are very rare because of the dryads. Thalia must be waiting for these leaves, I don't want to keep her waiting. Bring her these leaves and be quick.
