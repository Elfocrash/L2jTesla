Ah... it is a letter from Rosella, my godmother. How is she? I have been so busy lately, I was unable to pay her a visit. I hope she doesn't think I am heartless. But you, I see you're searching for the Magical Powers Ruby. It symbolizes fire among people who study magic, right?<br>
The ruby is a jewel that has been the symbol of our family for two hundred years, so there is no one in Oren or Gludio that knows it better than I do. Originally, rubies could be extracted from the mines in the northern part of Gludio. However, they collapsed during the war with Gracia and not a trace remains.<br>
Since then, we have been unable to mine any more rubies in this area. Fortunately, I have a little bit of the magically powered ruby with me. However, being as precious as it is, I cannot give it to you for free, but I will give it to you if you do me one favor.<br>
