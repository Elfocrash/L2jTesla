<html><body>Magister Greenis:<br>
You have collected five clumps of Red Down. Now I can make new magical powers rubies. I'm relieved that I can fulfill my duties.<br>
Next time, please come and watch how I make the magically powered ruby. I will tell you how it's made. Here, I will give you this Magical Powers Ruby as a gift.<br>
And now there is a word of advice that I would like to give you. Don't be lazy in your magic studies once you become an Elven Wizard. When I was traveling near the Ivory Tower a long time ago, I heard that the high-level Mystics there spend twelve hours or more each day on their studies doing research. Studying is not everything, but there is a limit to what you can do through talent alone. I pray you'll develop your magical ability and enrich the proud heritage of the Elves.
