<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br>
Thank you very much. Now I can meditate in peace. I was thinking of going to some other land because it was so noisy. As a token of my appreciation, I give you the token of wind.<br>
Searcher of the wind, please do not forget your naive curiosity about materials.<br>
Curiosity always leads to investigation. The deep contemplation and research of a magician is very often compared to the deep waters of a lake.<br>
Now you must find the <font color="LEVEL">token of water</font>. <font color="LEVEL">In order to find it, you must meet the undine of the water. She is near Fellmere Lake.</font> The lake can be found if you pass the abandoned camp of the Ol Mahums in the north and continue a little farther north. Well then, may the divine protection of wind be with you.
