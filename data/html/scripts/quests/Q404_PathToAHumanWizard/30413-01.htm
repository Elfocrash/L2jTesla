<html><body>Water Undine:<br>
Don't be a nuisance and disappear. I am busy purifying the force of water in the surrounding land!<br>
You want to earn the token of water? Well then, do me one favor. Do you see that lake? On the other side of the lake is a monster shaped like a strange eye called the <font color="LEVEL">Water Seer</font>. It disturbs the force of water in this area and really gives me a headache.<br>
Would you be willing to go kill the <font color="LEVEL">Water Seer</font> and bring back two sparkling pebbles as proof? Then I will give you the token of water.
