Wait! Do not deceive yourself into thinking I am a mere lizard just because I look like a basilisk. Although my appearance is unremarkable, I am a spirit of earth, which studies the principles of the world embodied within the soil and rock. Right now I am looking for a way to purify the negative forces that have seeped into the earth in these ruins.<br>
You say you are looking for the token of earth? Then I must test you to see if you are qualified to earn it. Just because the spirits of water, fire and wind have acknowledged you doesn't mean that I will do so as easily.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">It is your task to find Red Soil that contains the strong life of the earth. You can obtain it by hunting a bear called the red bear that lives in this vicinity. </font>The red bear can be found in the Fellmere Harvest Grounds between the Ruins of Agony and the Orc Barracks.
