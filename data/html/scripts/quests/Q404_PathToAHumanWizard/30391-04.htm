To become a Human Wizard, you must have the four tokens of water, fire, wind and earth. If you are not acknowledged by nature, which controls these four elements, you do not have the right to be called a Wizard. Go out into the world and collect the four tokens. The collection of the tokens can only be accomplished by your own power. This is all I can do for you.<br>
