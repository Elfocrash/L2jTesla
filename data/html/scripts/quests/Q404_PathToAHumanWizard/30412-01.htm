<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br>
I see you have come to find the token of wind. The winds blowing here told me of your story. If you grant me one favor, I will happily give you the token of wind.<br>
Not long ago, <font color="LEVEL">the wastelands Lizardman</font> appeared in the southern Wastelands, and it has been so noisy ever since that I haven't been able to savor the wind comfortably.<br>
Please make the wastelands Lizardman quiet so my meditations are not disrupted. Then I will give you the token of wind.<br>
Since scary monsters are prowling around on the southern hills, it would be safer for you to follow the western path of the valley and then head south.
