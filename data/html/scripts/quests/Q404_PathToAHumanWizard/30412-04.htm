<html><body>Wind Sylph:<br>
I see you have already earned the token of wind from me. What you must find now is the token of water. To find it, you must meet the undine of the water.<br>
The undine of the water is at Fellmere Lake. To find the lake, you must go north of here. Go pass the abandoned camp where the Ol Mahums are and go a little more north to reach Fellmere Lake.
