<html><body>Earth Snake:<br>
You've brought the Red Soil! So fast for a Human! I thought you would have more trouble than that. As promised, I'll exchange the Ring of Earth for a Token of Earth. Don't lose the faith, pilgrim.<br>
Once you've collected the tokens of fire, water, wind and earth, speak with Parina in Gludin. She has a special affinity for the spirits of the four elements, for they are constantly whispering into her ear. She will raise your understanding of magic to new heights.
