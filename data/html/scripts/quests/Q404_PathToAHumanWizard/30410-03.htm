I'm very sorry about that ... I didn't know I was making that much noise. Actually, I've been digging in the ground to bury my eggs here. I finished digging yesterday, and I've buried the eggs, so I won't be noisy any more. Won't you tell her that I'm really sorry?<br>
I also found this feather while I was digging. It may belong to the sylph. Please show it to her.
