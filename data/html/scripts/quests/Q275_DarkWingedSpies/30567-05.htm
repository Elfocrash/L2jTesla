Well done! With this, we can cast a shield around the king's hall and surrounding buildings for the time being, to prevent the secret agents of Varangka from peeking in. Before we can dispatch an expedition team to deal with Varangka, they must first receive the protection of the shield. We need more bat fangs in the future.<br>
For now, receive this money, help yourself to our excellent food and drink, and have a good rest. Come back when you are ready to fight once more for our race.
