<font color="LEVEL">Kill the darkwing bats and bring their fangs.</font> Fangs should not be broken or scratched! Bring only the intact ones; a total of <font color="LEVEL">seventy</font> fangs are required.<br>
As long as the darkwing bats act as the eyes and ears of Varangka, he can see every move we make. We should make him go blind by sending an expedition to defeat him. You must be careful when hunting darkwing bats. Varangka's trackers may attack you. Make sure you are always on your guard. Good luck!
