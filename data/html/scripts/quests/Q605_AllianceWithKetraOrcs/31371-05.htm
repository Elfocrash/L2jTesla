<html><body>Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:<br>
You're the best friend the Ketra ever had! The more you fight for the Ketra, the more we will trust you.<br>
Our war against the Varka Orcs continues. We must drive those revolting goat beards from the face of the earth! Kill <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos great mystics, captains, grand seers, prophets, prophet's disciples, prophet's royal guards, chief magi and chief escorts</font>. Kill them all and take their badges as proof.<br>
Bring back <font color="LEVEL">300 badges of grunts, 200 badges of officers and 100 badges of captains</font>. Good luck, my friend!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if you laid a hand on our Ketra Orcs in the middle, our confidence in you will fade away and our alliance with you will be destroyed!!</font>
