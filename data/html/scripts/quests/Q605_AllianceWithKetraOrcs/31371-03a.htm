Well, I suppose I'll give you a chance... If you can gain my trust, the Ketras will trust you as well. Your test is simple. Annihilate those filthy Varka Silenos! Kill as many as you can! As proof, bring back <font color="LEVEL">100 badges of Varka Soldiers</font>.<br>
Get the badges by slaying Varka Silenos <font color="LEVEL">Recruits, Footmen, Scouts, Hunters and Shamans</font>. This will build trust with our tribe.<br>
Now get going!
