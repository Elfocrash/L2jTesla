<html><body>Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:<br>
There are many degrees of trust and friendship. The more you fight for the Ketra, the more we will trust you.<br>
If we are to defeat the Varka Silenos, we must destroy their command staff! Kill every one of their filthy commanders you can! We must annihilate them all!<br>
If you bring 200 badges of grunts and 100 badges of officers from the Varka Silenos, our trust in you will be increased significantly. You can get the badges of Varka officers by slaying their <font color="LEVEL">priests, warriors, mediums, magi, officers, legionnaire captains, and elite escorts</font>. Now go and get them!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if you laid a hand on our Ketra Orcs in the middle, our confidence in you will fade away and our alliance with you will be destroyed!!</font>
