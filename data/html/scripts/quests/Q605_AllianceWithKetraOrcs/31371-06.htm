Ha ha ha! I'll bet those filthy goat beards peed all over themselves! Such is the pleasure of an overwhelming victory! Our job isn't finished yet, however. This war won't be over until every single Varka lies dead!<br>
 Your excellent reputation is spreading like wildfire among the Ketras! However, it is said that there are several steps in friendship. You're now in the middle. If you want to raise our esteem for you even further, attack the Varka Silenos again and bring us <font color="LEVEL">300 badges of grunts, 300 badges of officers, 200 badges of captains and a Totem of Valor</font>. You are fully qualified. Show your real power. The stronger someone is, the more he will be loved by Ketras! You can get the totem by successfully finishing the <font color="LEVEL">Prove Your Courage!</font> quest assigned by Hierarch Kadun Zu Ketra.<br>
 <font color="LEVEL">However, if you laid a hand on our Ketra Orcs in the middle, our confidence in you will fade away and our alliance with you will be destroyed!!</font>
