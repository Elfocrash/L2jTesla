<html><body>Captain Bezique:<br>
My my ... you are quite stubborn. Fine. If you must play the part of the hero ... why don't you go and hunt the spiders that have been wreaking havoc lately? Giant spiders have recently been reported upturning farmers' carts, raiding sheep and cattle, and even attacking Humans.<br>
 The monsters you need to hunt are called <font color="LEVEL">poison spiders, or arachnid tracker</font>. Cut off their legs, then bring back twenty of them and I will give you the coin of the lords. Go to the Windmill Hill on the left of the southern coastal road and you will see lots of them appearing. I must follow procedure, so being captain of the guards, I give you this mark to take with you.<br>
Well then, I hope you return with your life!
