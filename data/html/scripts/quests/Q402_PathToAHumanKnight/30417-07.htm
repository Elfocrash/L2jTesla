Traditionally, the lord of those civilians that receive the aid of an esquire invites him to his castle as a token of thanks. A feast is given and the esquire is rewarded with gold coins. However, these days, the <font color="LEVEL">Coin of Lords</font> has become an informal custom. The Coin of Lords is a gold coin engraved with the mark of the province. It signifies thanks in the name of the lord. Those who have the authority to bestow it are mostly the village Guard Captains and High Priests.<br>
Whether or not an esquire can be acknowledged as a formal Human Knight depends on how many coins of lords he returns with after completing his pilgrim's journey.<br>
If you wish to enter the knight guild and earn the title of Human Knight, you must go through this trial. You, comrade of the sword, will you take the trial of the esquire?<br>
