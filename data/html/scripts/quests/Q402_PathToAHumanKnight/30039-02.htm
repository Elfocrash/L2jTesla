<html><body>Captain Gilbert:<br>
Giant spiders have always existed on Talking Island. They used to only live on the northern part of the island, but lately incidents of their attacking homes and carrying off livestock have increased. They are so huge and ferocious that it is sometimes too difficult for the guard troop to deal with them.<br>
Please. Destroy the giant spiders. <font color="LEVEL">Hunt the spiders and peel off their husks. Return with twenty husks and I will give you the coin of the lords. </font> I am sorry to ask you to do such a dangerous task, but I cannot think of anyone but you who could possibly manage this.
