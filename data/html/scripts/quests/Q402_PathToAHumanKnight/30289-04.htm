<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
I can still hear the despairing cries of my priest brothers who are not yet at rest. <font color="LEVEL">Please find twelve Einhasad crosses from the undead in the Ruins of Despair south of the village and bring them to me</font> so that I can perform a ceremony to soothe the spirits of the dead priests.<br>
May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.
