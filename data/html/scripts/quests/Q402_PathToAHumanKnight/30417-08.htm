<html><body>Sir Klaus Vasper:<br>
Good! I, Sir Vasper, guardian knight of the western region, commit you unto the trial of the esquire. During the trial, keep this mark on you at all times. With this, the people will know that you are an esquire in pilgrimage.<br>
Go around the various villages in Gludio and meet the <font color="LEVEL">Guard Captains</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">High Priests</font>. They will present you with various tasks that an esquire can do for the people. If you perform these tasks, you will receive a Coin of Lords. If you bring back <font color="LEVEL">three</font> or more coins, you can complete the trial of the esquire.<br>
Very well, you should now depart on your journey. May the divine blessing of Einhasad be with you.
