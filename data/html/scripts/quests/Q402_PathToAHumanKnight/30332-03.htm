<html><body>Captain Bathis:<br>
Have you defeated the bugbear raiders? What do you mean, not yet? What have you done all this time?! I have already reported to my superiors that I have sent out soldiers to destroy the bugbears ... What will they take me for?!<br>
At this very moment, the Traders that do business with Dion are losing quite a bit of profit by having to take the long way around on the southern coastal road! This is not the time for you to be fooling around in the village! Go defeat the bugbears and bring back <font color="LEVEL">ten necklaces</font>. Then I will give you the coin of the lords!
