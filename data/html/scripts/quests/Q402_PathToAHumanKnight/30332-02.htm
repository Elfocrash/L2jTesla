<html><body>Captain Bathis:<br>
If you follow the road northeast of the village, you will cross a river that marks the area between Gludio and Neutral Zone. There is <font color="LEVEL">a bridge</font> that crosses the river. Recently, <font color="LEVEL">bugbear raiders</font> have appeared around the area between the bridge and the Neutral Zone and attacked trader coaches. Already twenty traders have lost their lives, and the goods that were stolen are too numerous to list. The traders have requested funds from the trader's guild headquarters in order to hire mercenaries, but the guild has yet to answer their request.<br>
I would be much obliged if you would get rid of the bugbears. According to the reports, there are about ten bugbears that attacked the trader coaches. Kill them and bring back <font color="LEVEL">ten necklaces</font>. While on this task, you will be performing an official task of the Gludio guards, so take this with you.
