<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
There is no doubt that Einhasad has guided your footsteps here. You see, something is troubling me, and I was thinking of asking for the help of the knights.<br>
A few years ago, during the war with Gracia, we sent several priests to a small village in the south, now called the Ruins of Despair. There, the priests treated the wounded and performed funerals for the dead. But the village was suddenly attacked by mercenaries and the wounded soldiers, village people, and the priests of Einhasad were all brutally murdered<br>
The spirits of the dead have no peace and still haunt the ruins in the form of undead. It is the duty of a priest to console their spirits and put them to rest through prayer, but it is too dangerous of a task for someone not trained as a Cleric, like myself, to face the vicious monsters of black magic. That is why I am asking you a favor.<br>
