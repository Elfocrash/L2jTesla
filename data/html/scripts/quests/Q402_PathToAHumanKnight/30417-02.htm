<html><body>Sir Klaus Vasper:<br>
My comrade of the sword, you do not have enough experience to become a Knight yet. Looking at your eyes, I see that the passion and faith in your heart is not false, but that alone is not sufficient to become a Knight. As long as you live in this world full of immorality, you need power to fuel your faith, and that power comes from experience on the battlefield.<br>
Train a little more before you come back. When that day comes, I will test you to see if have the talents to become a true Human Knight.
