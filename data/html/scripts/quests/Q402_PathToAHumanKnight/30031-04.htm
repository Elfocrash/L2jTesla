<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
You have brought back ten skulls from the ruins. With these, I can perform a proper funeral service for the elves that were slain a long time ago. May the departed spirits of the ruins forget their resentment of a thousand years, and gain peace within the arms of Einhasad.<br>
Please take this coin ... This is proof that you have given a great contribution to the people of Gludio. May your sword continue to be used to punish evil, and your shield be used to protect the righteous. May the protection of light be with you!
