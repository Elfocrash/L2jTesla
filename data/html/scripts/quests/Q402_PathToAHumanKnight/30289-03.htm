<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
Esquire, I beg you! Please go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font> to the south of the village and find the <font color="LEVEL">departed spirits of the priests</font> that have turned into the undead. Destroy them with your sword and recover the Einhasad crosses that are somewhere on their bodies. <font color="LEVEL">If you bring back twelve Einhasad crosses, I can perform a mass that soothes the spirits of the dead priests.</font><br>
Before you go, take this. It is a mark that shows you are performing a holy task for the church of Einhasad.<br>
Well than, I shall pray for your safe return. May the light of Einhasad guide you.
