Three coins of lords are the minimum condition in order to become a Human Knight. If you think that you are not ready, continue your pilgrimage. If there are villages in Gludio that you have not gone to yet, go to them and meet the Guard Captains or High Priests. I heard one enthusiastic esquire even journeyed to Talking Island.
