<html><body>Sir Collin Windawood:<br>
Greetings, traveler. I see you are an esquire. You are to be commended for having come all the way to this isolated island on your pilgrimage. I am a member of the Knight League myself, but I do not really like Knights. All those I was acquainted with on the mainland spoke of justice and sacrifice, but were very calculating people who did not involve themselves in fights that were unprofitable.<br>
During the war with Gracia, the civil troops fought for their lives in the mud with crude spears while those that called themselves Knights discussed tactics at the table, hiding behind the castle walls. In my eyes, the courage and sacrifice of the farmer that died while fighting to protect their villages was far nobler than the virtue of any Knight. The will to put your faith into action -- that is what I think chivalry is.<br>
Good luck, esquire! When you end your trial and become a Human Knight, please remember our talk today. Well then, may the divine protection of Einhasad be with you.
