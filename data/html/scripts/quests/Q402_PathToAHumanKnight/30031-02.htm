<html><body>High Priest Biotin:<br>
Long ago, this place was where the Elves taught the Humans magic. However, not long after, the Humans betrayed the Elves and went to war with them. In the end, we Humans repaid kindness with betrayal.<br>
Although it was committed by our ancestors, we inherited their sin. We are still paying for their actions. On this island, dead Elves are unable to rest and became undead called <font color="LEVEL">silent horrors</font> and threaten the island residents.<br>
Wouldn't it be best to put the souls of the elves slain by humans to rest, and ask pardon of their souls? I would like to ask you to do this favor. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font> and defeat the silent horrors. And please come back with <font color="LEVEL">ten of their skulls</font>. I would like to perform a proper funeral service so the spirits of the elves can obtain rest.
