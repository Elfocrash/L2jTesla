You want to become a Human Knight? Then you must go through the <font color="LEVEL">trial of the esquire</font> to prove that you are not merely a rash, hot-blooded fighter, but one with true knightly spirit. This is a form of ritual and a process of training that all who desire to become a Human Knight must perform.<br>
