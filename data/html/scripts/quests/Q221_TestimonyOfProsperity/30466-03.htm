Yes, it is only the thought that counts. There is one thing that my mother loves, now that I think about it. It is a <font color="LEVEL">bouquet made from Mandragora Petals</font>. I don't know the story behind it, but she always seems quietly happy whenever I give her that bouquet.<br>
I will create one for you to give her if you will bring me the materials. I will need <font color="LEVEL">20 mandragora flower petals</font> and <font color="LEVEL">10 bunches of Crimson Moss</font>. You can get the petals from the <font color="LEVEL">mandragoras</font> plants that grow on the western part of the execution grounds. The moss can be found near the <font color="LEVEL">giant crimson ants of the Cruma marshlands</font>. Good luck on your journey!
