Ah, Mion... So rich, but always late with guild payments. This is not the first time this has happened. She ignores her obligations on purpose. She must be taught a lesson! I see you have received Maryse Redbonnet's dues. I thought she was so blinded by revenge that she couldn't see anything else. At least she knows how to pay.<br>
Many thanks for your troubles! Here is the <font color="LEVEL">receipt</font>. Take this to the First Elder.
