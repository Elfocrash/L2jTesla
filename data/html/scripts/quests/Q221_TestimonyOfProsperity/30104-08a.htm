Absolute Geometry is an ancient science passed down to us by Maphr. It is the explanation of everything, the laws of space and motion for all things. <font color="LEVEL">He who understands Absolute Geometry can control the world</font>.<br>
Our ancestors pursued the study of Absolute Geometry, which led to discoveries in mathematics, thermodynamics, measurement, architecture, astronomy, navigation and economics. This knowledge enabled us to build great architecture such as the sky garden of Shootguart and the great palace of Harnark. We were able to replace the barter system with the concept of monetary economy, and to develop warrior golems and such.<br>
But since the downfall of Giants, most of this technology has been lost. What a pity...<br>
