This won't be very difficult. I only ask that you collect some overdue <font color="LEVEL">guild dues</font> on my behalf. All guild members must pay dues periodically, but there are some who have not yet paid, even though their due dates have long passed. The Steel Gate Guild dues have all been collected, but some of the other guilds have some delinquent members. <font color="LEVEL">I would like you to visit them and collect their guild dues</font>. I'm sure this will be a swift task for you.<br>
Here, take this badge and report to the <font color="LEVEL">5 Elders</font> here with me. They will give you the names of the delinquent members. Go and collect the dues and return them to the Elders. Collect <font color="LEVEL">5 receipts</font> from the other Elders and bring them to me.
