May the abundance of Maphr be with you! Well, look at you! Aren't you the one that hunted blade bats for me? So, how are you doing? I'm sure your situation has improved thanks to the hard work you did back then.. You look good! I wouldn't be surprised to see you get a promotion soon!<br>
Ah! You are collecting guild dues on behalf of the First Elder? Wait a minute. All right... Let's see who has not paid his dues yet! Oh my! That infamous rascal <font color="LEVEL">Carrier Torocco</font> has not yet paid! I knew it. Always the troublemaker, he is! Go and collect the guild dues from Torocco.
