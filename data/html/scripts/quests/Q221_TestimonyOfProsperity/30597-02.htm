Hope..., Yes, I suppose there is hope after all...<br>
These days the hired troops are taking care of the Orcs while my brothers and I work day and night to reclaim the land. Someday this farm will boast the richest land in the kingdom of Aden!<br>
So you seek the <font color="LEVEL">Token of the Fertile Lands</font>? Then you shall have it. I was given this from another Dwarf. He appeared at a time when I had just come to this barren land and was having no luck growing crops. He gave me a seed and said that <font color="LEVEL">the blessings of Maphr were within it</font>.<br>
When I planted this seed it enriched the soil and my harvests have been improving steadily since then. I put back some of the seeds and have saved them until this day. Now I shall share the seeds with you. This gift from one Dwarf I now give to another.
