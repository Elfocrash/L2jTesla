<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Parman:<br>
This is a piece of Maphr's Tablet! What a find you've made! Ah, Parman you old rascal, you've always had an eye for fresh talent. And look at what you've brought in! The elders will be very pleased when I relate this juicy bit of news at the next Centurions meeting. Listen . . . this is for your ears only, you understand . . . I heard that another piece of the tablet was discovered not long ago. Thanks to your discovery, we're even closer to unlocking the secrets of Maphr's mathematics.<br>
Now I have to send this piece to the Dwarven village so the elders can decode it. They're the only ones who can still read Titan, you understand -- humble folk like us have no clue what we've unearthed.<br>
Again, congratulations! You've passed the second test with flying colors, and I will now reward you with the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Prosperity</font>. Keep your nose to the grindstone, youngster, and you'll rise high in this guild. May you one day enjoy Maphr's prosperity!
