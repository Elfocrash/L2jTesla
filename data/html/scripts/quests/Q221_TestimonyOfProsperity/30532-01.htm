<html><body>Elder Spiron:<br>
May you be blessed with wealth and the virtue of generosity! I am Spiron, the Chief Elder of the Golden Wheel Guild.<br>
Ah! I remember you. Did you not rid us of the goblin brigand? Though my memory has faded somewhat... You have grown much since I last saw you.<br>
So, you have come to collect guild dues on behalf of the First Elder? Let's have a look at the delinquent payments... Oh! I see <font color="LEVEL">Trader Shari of the weapons shop</font> has not yet made his payment. I hear business has been bad since travelers have started to trade among themselves... I guess his financial worries are as bad as they say...<br>
Go to Shari and collect his dues, and then return with his payment.
