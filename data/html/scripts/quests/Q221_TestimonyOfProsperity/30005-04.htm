<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Wilford:<br>
An Elf more than 1,000 years old? Yes, that's it! You mean <font color="LEVEL">Lilith</font>! Yes, she didn't just live for more than a thousand years, she has been waiting for her lover for over 1,000 years. So that means that she must be well over 1,000 years old.<br>
I don't know if Elves just have unusually long life spans, or if she missed her lover so much that she could not die.<br>
You should go and see Lilith for yourself. You can find her in the <font color="LEVEL">temple of this town</font>. She is quite gloomy these days, so why don't you take her this brooch as a present? It might cheer her up, Elves adore pretty ornaments.
