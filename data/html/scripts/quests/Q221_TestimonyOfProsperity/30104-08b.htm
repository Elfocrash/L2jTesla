Maphr's Tablet is written in the language of the Giants, but we <font color="LEVEL">Dwarves are the true owners of the tablet</font>. It was the Dwarves who learned directly from Maphr and to this day we retain our traditions of manufacturing, trading, and architecture! Other races, ignorant to our advances in math, dynamics, measurement and architecture won't even be able to follow the basics of Absolute Geometry.<br>
Obtaining Maphr's Tablet has always been our greatest wish and long-cherished dream. If only we could recover the secrets of Absolute Geometry, we would be able to rebuild our kingdom of Dwarves, and eventually control the entire continent! We could create a world where everything runs smoothly like a well-greased cogwheel...That is our heaven which we will create with our own hands.<br>
Unfortunately legend says that Maphr's Tablet was damaged when the war between the Gods and the Giants broke out. It is said that fearing the advanced technology of the Giants, the gods stole the tablet, broke it into 12 pieces and scattered it across the continent.<br>
