<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
You joined the union and now you act like your struggle is over! You must start preparing to be an upper-level member of the union! How about a Bounty Hunter or a Warsmith?<br>
In order to advance in the union you must pass the <font color="LEVEL">Test of Prosperity</font>. It is much harder than the test you took to join the union, and you are not ready for it. Return when you have more experience and we'll talk about your future.<br>
(Quest for Dwarves who have completed an occupation change and are of level 37 and above.)
