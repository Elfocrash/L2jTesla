So, you have found all 4 of the tokens? Let's see...<br>
The account book of the first elder Lockirin. This is indeed a suitable token of wealth!<br>
The recipe of Emily? Ah, this was given to you by the woman who bore and raised 12 children, the secret recipe passed down through her family that is traditionally eaten after giving birth to a child. It is perfect as the proof of fertility!<br>
Is the next a seed? Yes, I can smell the scent of a matured seed. I guess it must be a seed which Maphr, the God of earth has blessed. Good!<br>
Oh! Isn't this an Elven wafer? I guess it is from the Elf on Talking Island that has lived for more than a millennia. At one time wafers were common, but they have been rarely seen in modern times. I'm surprised you were able to get one, as wafers are known for not being sold nor given to other races.<br>
