Excellent! You have copied the keyhole! Well done! Now give me a moment while I write down the <font color="LEVEL">recipe for the key</font>. Now... shall we get started Mapping the key's structure? Hmmm...I see that it is a very complicated structure in which many triple spirals are layered and connected to double spirals. I have never seen such a fantastic thing. But it won't be a problem for me!<br>
Done! <font color="LEVEL">I guarantee that you will be able to open the box if you follow the recipe</font>. Just collect the needed materials. I will tell you which creatures you must hunt, as well. You will find everything in the Cruma Marshlands, so don't worry. I don't think this will be a problem for you. If everything is clear, let's get started!
