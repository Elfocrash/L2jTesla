Great Mother...? Yes, I have borne and raised 12 children. Surprised? People are always telling me that I do not look my age. People call me the <font color="LEVEL">'Great Mother'</font>. So embarrassing... There's nothing great about it.<br>
I loved my husband and children so much that I bore and raised as many as I could. It was terribly hard when I lost my husband in battle. Raising the children alone became so hard that I considered sending them away to foster homes. But we carried on through it all, and my children have all grown up and married. Well, all but my youngest. My work will be done when my youngest has married and set up house for himself. I will feel relief and sadness at the same time.<br>
