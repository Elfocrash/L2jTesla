<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Parman:<br>
You should consider aspiring to be an upper-level member of the union, possibly a Bounty Hunter or a Warsmith. What do you think? Keep it in mind.<br>
In order to be an upper-level member, you must pass the <font color="LEVEL">Test of Prosperity</font>. You are not yet ready to take this test. Return when you advance beyond apprentice and we will discuss your future.<br>
(Quest only for Dwarves who have changed occupations and are of level 37 or above.)
