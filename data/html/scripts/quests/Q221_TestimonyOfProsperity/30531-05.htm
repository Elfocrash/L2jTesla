<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
Golden Wheel, Silver Balance, Black Anvil, Bronze Key, and Gray Pillar... Yes, that is all 5 receipts. Thank you for your troubles. I find overdue payment collections so tiresome. As the First Elder, I don't have time to chase down every freeloader. Thanks to you, all the accounts are settled. We are in your debt.<br>
You mentioned a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Wealth</font>? This should do nicely. Here is an <font color="LEVEL">accounting book</font> that I have been keeping since I was a very young Dwarf. If you read this, you will discover the secrets of my wealth. Good luck with you future in the guild!
