Recently news came to us of an ancient relic thought to be a part of Maphr's Tablet. Since the tablet was made during the era of the Giants, it seems very likely that it will be found somewhere among the Giants' Ruins. <font color="LEVEL">The investigation team exploring the Cruma Tower has reported that they have discovered a box in which they think the fragments of Maphr's Tablet are contained.</font><br>
You must go to the site and collect Maphr's Tablet fragments! This will not be an easy task. First, go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Nikola</font> there. You should find him near the <font color="LEVEL">entrance of the Cruma Tower</font>. He will tell you more.
