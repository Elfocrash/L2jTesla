<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
Remember to speak with all <font color="LEVEL">5 Elders</font> about overdue guild dues and make collections immediately. The elders will each give you a receipt when you turn in the dues to them. Collect all <font color="LEVEL">5 receipts</font> and bring them to me. Then you shall have your Mark of Wealth.
