<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Parman:<br>
As you know, Dwarves worship Maphr, the god of prosperity. Prosperity is not only the highest virtue, it is the measure of morality! For your first test, you will discover what <font color="LEVEL">"prosperity"</font> really means.<br>
Bring back 4 proofs of prosperity. Prosperity traditionally has 4 components: wealth, fertile lands, fertility and sound body. To pass the test, find all <font color="LEVEL">4 proofs of prosperity</font>.<br>
While performing the test, carry this ring with you. Other guildsmen will recognize it and render assistance to you. When you have found all the proofs, submit them to the guild and you will pass the first test. May Maphr grant you luck!<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.<br>
