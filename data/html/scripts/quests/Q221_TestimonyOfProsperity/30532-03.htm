Thank you very much. With this payment all of our members have paid their dues. Here is the <font color="LEVEL">receipt</font>. Please take this to First Elder Lockirin.<br>
I hear Shari's business is not doing so well. I wonder how she managed to pay her dues...? What? She went into debt to make this payment? My my! I didn't know her financial status was that bad! I'll help her this time. I cannot ignore the troubles of a fellow guild member. I'll make her payment for her, and return her money. Good job, you can be on your way. I'll take care of the rest.
