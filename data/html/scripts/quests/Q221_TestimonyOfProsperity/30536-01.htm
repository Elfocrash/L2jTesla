<html><body>Elder Arin:<br>
I am Arin Curdhammer, a representative of the Black Anvil Guild. But wait! Haven't we met before? You look very familiar. Hmmm. Very strange, I never forget a face... Oh, well, I guess I am getting old.. Let's get on with the business at hand.<br>
Let's see, who has not paid his dues... Dear, dear! <font color="LEVEL">Master Toma</font> is late with his payment! Oh my...this is quite a predicament. He is certainly old enough to know better... He hasn't been here for ages, probably still off roaming about the countryside. He must have forgotten that his guild dues are due.<br>
Please! Go to Master Toma and bring back his dues payment. He won't be easy to find, as he is always wandering...
