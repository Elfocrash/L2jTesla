Well, look what the cat dragged in! Long time no see! Seems like only yesterday that you were hunting Bearded Keltirs in these parts. Now look at you!<br>
Surprised that I remembered you, eh? Oh, I never forget a face -- especially that of a fellow guild member. So what brings you all the way out here?<br>
My dues!? I paid my dues 2 weeks ago! Are you calling me a liar?! Hmmph! I even have a receipt...somewhere around here... In any case, you'd best go straight to <font color="LEVEL">Filaur</font> and get all this straightened out. Accusing honest Dwarves of cheating their guild -- hmmph!
