I know the materials needed to create the key, but still lack the shape. I need your help with this. Please go to the tower and copy the pattern of the keyhole! If we have a <font color="LEVEL">copy of the keyhole</font> we can write down the recipe for making the key.<br>
Now take this clay and copy the pattern of the keyhole.
