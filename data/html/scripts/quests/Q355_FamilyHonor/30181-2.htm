The thieves who stole my precious sculptures are the <font color="LEVEL">Timak orc troop</font>. According to my nephew, the troop consists of <font color="LEVEL">Timak orc troop archers, timak orc troop warriors, timak orc troop leaders and the Timak orc troop shaman</font>. I doubt that those brutes even know the value of what they have!<br>
If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">"Galfredo Romer's Busts"</font>, I will pay you handsomely. If you bring me 100 or more of them at one time, you will receive a bonus. Please try your best!<br>
You can keep any other sculptures you recover. You can sell them to a store or give them to someone as a gift.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">They move around in a group, so it is not a bad idea to go with a couple of friends, if they wish to.</font> Good luck! I'm counting on you.
