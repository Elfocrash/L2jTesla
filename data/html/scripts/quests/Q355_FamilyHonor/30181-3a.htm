Welcome back! I've been waiting for you. Were you successful? I trust that you destroyed the Timak orc troop and brought back my goods?<br>
As I told you, all I want is "Galfredo Romer's Busts". You can keep the other <font color="LEVEL">works of sculptor Berona</font> for yourself. You should be able to sell them for a fairly good price.<br>
Or... if you would like, you can also take them to the <font color="LEVEL">antique dealer Patrin</font> over there and get them appraised. Since we are close friends, I'll put in a good word for you. If the statues are prototypes or originals they are more valuable. If they are imitations or fakes, then they are worthless. It's a gamble.<br>
