You want to quit? Sigh...! That's the problem with today's young people... always hopping from job to job, they never stay in one place very long! Don't you know that once you accept a job, you should finish it? Dear me...<br>
Oh, well, if that is really what you want, I won't stop you. Thank you for your hard work.
