Have you ever tried <font color="LEVEL">Dreviant Wine</font>? It's the sweetest, but most dangerous wine that those of my race enjoy drinking. The wine is made from the distilled poison of spiders, you see. Only a few people in the entire continent, including myself, know how to make this wine. I had the opportunity to learn this skill before Patriarch Mitraell was entrapped by that seal. Rumor has it that the Drevanul whispered into the Patriarch's ear how to make this precious wine.<br>
Perhaps it is because the secret has been passed down from the Drevanuls, but when our brothers who practice the dark arts drink this wine, their understanding of magic is heightened momentarily. Since I am not well versed in magic, I do not know if this is true or not.<br>
In a few weeks Mr. Vollodos will be importing an order of grapes cultivated from the land of Gludio, and I plan to purchase them and try making a few bottles of dreviant wine for myself. The most difficult ingredient to find is the spider's poison. I may have to ask your help for that...<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 18 and above.)
