Thank you! You are so generous!<br>
There are Maille Lizardmen around here. They always try to steal the things going out from this town.<br>
Wouldn't you be upset if your generosity, the Work Hammer, could not reach Talking Island because it was stolen by thieves?<br>
So, please take the Maille Lizardmen down. I would be grateful if you could take out the <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardman Guards, Maille Lizardman Scouts, and Maille Lizardmen.</font> Defeat 30 of them.</body></html>
