The Ragna Orcs are gathering their power, being careful not to expose themselves. This is a good time to use guerrilla tactics. If you can, please bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Cursed Dolls</font> that the Ragna Orcs use to control their evil creatures. About <font color="LEVEL">180 of them</font> should be enough.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Ragna Orcs have the most Cursed Dolls, but among the summoned evil creatures, the Dark Corpse, Guardian of the Ghost Town and Varangka's Succubus also have them.</font> Please help us!
