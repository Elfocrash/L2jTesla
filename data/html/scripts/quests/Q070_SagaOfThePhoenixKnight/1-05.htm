First, I'll need an <font color="LEVEL">ice crystal</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">fat white fish</font>. The dish's name is deceptive. It's actually a lovely cold dish made of fish. As ice crystals are the <font color="LEVEL">legendary food material, Chef Jeremy can tell you more of the details</font>.<br>
You can either get the fish from a fisherman or catch it yourself!
