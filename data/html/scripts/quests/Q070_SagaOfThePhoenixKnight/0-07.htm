<html><body>Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
There are many perspectives on justice.<br>
You have to fight by the light of the justice in your heart.<br>
My traveling days are over. You have transcended your country or religion as a Knight or Paladin with your values.<br>
Lead your life by the candle in your heart!
