 Here's the ice crystal... and, a fat white fish! You've brought both of them! The dish is very simple. This fish contains cold air. Cut it carefully into thin slices and wrap them around ice crystals... It makes a great sushi! It perfectly enhances the chill of the ice crystal and spreads the cold air around it. Use the scales to wrap it up and seal it. This dish is called Ice Cold Flower... And here it is!<br>
