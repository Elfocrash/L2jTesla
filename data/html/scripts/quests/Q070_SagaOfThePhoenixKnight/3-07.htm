<html><body>Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
The Orc shaman Tarkai recently gave me instructions on how to activate the Resonance Amulet.<br>
The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos both possess and worship magical fragments called the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>.<br>
You need one of these fragments to restore power to the Resonance Amulet! To get it, you'll have to win their trust.<br>
Which side will you get it from?<br>
