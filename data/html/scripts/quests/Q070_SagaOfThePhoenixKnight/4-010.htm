 Do you remember the oath you took when you first became a knight? To defend honor at all cost? Do you think the action of Sir Herod, who died a miserable death defending his honor, was a right one? What did you learn from the testimony of trust?<br>
Trust is what we knights have to give to people! Trust!<br>
Trust is also faith. You don't betray what you have faith in, nor those who have faith in you. There's only one more thing...<br>
You must discover how to earn trust from people....<br>
You probably already know all about this. I shouldn't need to explain it to you...<br>
Now, ask your last question to the stone tablet.<br>
