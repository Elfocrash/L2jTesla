<html><body>Black Cat:<br>
At one time, I was considered the most likely to succeed in the Hunters Union! Unfortunately, I made the mistake of challenging the power that was forbidden by the gods! This power allows whoever controls it to transcend Human limitations! But look where it got me!<br>
My body was totally ruined, and when I could no longer challenge the power, I was expelled from the union by my jealous rivals!<br>
I sank into a mass of self-pity and regret!<br>
But then, I had an idea! Maybe I can't do it personally, but I can certainly train and send someone on my behalf! Using my brain rather than physical force, and overcoming many political obstacles, I took control of the union! While in that position, I never found the competent person I needed. When I resigned, I was promised by the president of the union that I would be supplied with a competent person!<br>
He seemed credible then, he wasn't so obsessed with his coins at that point...<br>
Are you up to the challenge? Are you willing to risk injuries such as mine, or worse? Are you brave enough to seek the power?<br>
