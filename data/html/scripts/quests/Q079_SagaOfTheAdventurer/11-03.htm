Ah, yes, the second test... the Archon of Halisha has the fifth Resonance Amulet.<br>
After you get it from him, take it to the northwestern end of the Wall of Argos. Commune with the Tablet of Vision there.<br>
Slaying the Archon of Halisha isn't going to be easy!<br>
He can usually be found inside the Sepulchers, but if you attack his minions on the north side of the Wall of Argos, that usually draws him out!<br>
Good luck! Your success means that my long wait is finally over!</body></html>
