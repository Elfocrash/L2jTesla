<html><body>Filaur of the Gray Pillar:<br>
If you leave the village and go to the minefield, you will see many <font color="LEVEL">Utuku Orcs</font>. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">the Chrysolite Ore</font> that you collect after defeating them. I will reward you based on the amount of the ore you bring back.<br>
But more importantly, you should find out where the ore comes from. I ordered some investigators of the guild to find out, but I haven't gotten any useful information from them. I only know that there are many hidden chrysolite veins somewhere in the Spine Mine Field, and only a few Utuku Orcs know the locations.<br>
Sending investigators was a mistake, because the Orcs now know that the veins are important. I hear they tore the <font color="LEVEL">Maps that indicate the location of the veins</font> into many pieces and scattered them throughout the territory. If you find the pieces of the Maps, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Priestess of the Earth Chichirin</font> in the temple. She will help you to combine the Maps. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed Maps.
