Good! We understand each other well. Actually, I recently had a chance to see a destroyed granite golem, and within the remains I saw a piece of stone of a different hue. I asked Sarien, who has profound knowledge of magic, and he said the stone was a <font color="LEVEL">heartstone</font>. I found out that all the golems made by the magicians had a heartstone in the center of their bodies.<br>
What was it that he said? Something about putting a symbolic heart that resembles the living body into a still stone figure, and then gathering the magic forces before beginning the spells ... . Of course I didn't understand a word of what he was talking about, but anyway, it seems almost certain that the heartstone is the power source of the golem.<br>
So, I would like you to go into the Wastelands and get me the <font color="LEVEL">heartstone of a golem</font>. There are many <font color="LEVEL">granite golems</font> in the Wastelands. There are also granite golems that are nicknamed <font color="LEVEL">punchers,</font> because they Brandish their fists about fiercely.<br>
Most heartstones shatter or crack when the golem is killed, but very rarely you can obtain whole, perfect heartstones. I would like you to bring me all the heartstones you can find -- whether they be broken or whole. I will compensate you for as many as you bring back. Of course, I will be more generous for <font color="LEVEL">perfect heartstones</font>.
