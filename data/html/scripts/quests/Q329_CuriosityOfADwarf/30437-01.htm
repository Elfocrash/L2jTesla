As Elves are infatuated with poetry and songs and Orcs rave over war, we Dwarves love to make things with our very own hands. Ever since I was young, I immensely enjoyed fooling around with toys with springs or pocket watches. My dream is to make a <font color="LEVEL">golem</font> with my own hands some day.<br>
However, I am not talking about the animate, monster golems that you can see frequently. The golems made by the dwarves are automatic dolls that move according to minute mechanical devices. It is totally different from stone golems or granite golems, which are magically blessed with life.<br>
However, I always wondered what the energy source of a magically created golem would be. No matter how carefully I looked at it, I could not find the part that generated power ... . There are many golems in the wastelands here. They say it is because the devil Beleth and the magicians of the Ivory Tower used them as weapons of war in this land. If that is true, then that means that more than a thousand years have passed since the golems were abandoned in this land. Don't you find it surprising that they are still moving? What do you think? Aren't you getting curious, too? If you have time later, let's research it together.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 33 and above.)
