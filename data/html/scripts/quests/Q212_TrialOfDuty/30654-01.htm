<html><body>Sir Kiel Nighthawk:<br>
Greetings, young Warrior. I am Kiel Nighthawk of the Griffon Knight union. Hannavalt sent word that you were coming.<br>
One of the virtues that define a Knight's character is a <font color="LEVEL">sense of justice</font>. The history of this land of Dion is rife with gross injustice. One of the most heinous was the case of Sir Talianus.<br>
He was commissioned by the King to write a report about the causes and effects of the peasant's uprising. He was captured by rebels and accused of being a spy. He suffered days of unspeakable torture before death mercifully came. His report was torn up and scattered to the wind.<br>
His troops tried to collect the pieces of the report and they suffered the same fate as their leader.<br>
Until this day people claim that they hear the agonized wails of Sir Talianus and his troops, wafting across the execution grounds. I fear that their spirits are wandering the earth, unable to join with Shilen... Would you please seek justice for Sir Talianus?<br>
Kill the <font color="LEVEL">strains</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> to collect the <font color="LEVEL">torn pieces of the report</font>. When you gather all the pieces and complete <font color="LEVEL">Talianus' Report</font> bring it back to me.
