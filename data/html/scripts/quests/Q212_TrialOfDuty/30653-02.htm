I realize that it is not an easy task. But it is necessary for you to do it in order to acquire brilliance. You must kill the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit of Herod</font> with the rusty sword I gave you, and free him from his disgraceful curse. While killing the <font color="LEVEL">skeleton raiders wandering around the Wastelands</font> you will confront Herod.
