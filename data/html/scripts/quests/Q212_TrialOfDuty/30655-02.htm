May the blessings of the starlight shine upon you. Hello, young warrior. Welcome to the Hunters Village. True to Hannavalt's words, you seem to have the potential to become a great Knight someday.<br>
Let's briefly discuss the last virtue of a Knight, loyalty. Loyalty may be towards a lord, towards the teachings of the divine powers, or to a town and its residents whom you've sworn to protect... A good example would be the guards that risked their lives to battle the Leto Lizardmen and protect this village. The loyalty they displayed in sacrificing their lives to protect their homes and loved ones is surely honorable indeed.<br>
My task for you is to recover the <font color="LEVEL">milita's article</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardmen.</font> The families of the fallen guards wish to hold a memorial for them. Considering their sacrifice, should we not at least do this much for them? In order to hold the memorial, we need <font color="LEVEL">20 pieces of the articles.</font> Well then, good luck on your journey.<br>
Leto Lizardmen can be found on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
