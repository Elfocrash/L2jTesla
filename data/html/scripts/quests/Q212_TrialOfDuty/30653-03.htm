So the unfortunate knight was not able to recover his honor. Was this tear of return the only thing that remained? What a dreadful curse! So it is his fate to wander the Wastelands forever... He has no one to blame but himself.<br>
Well done! You have completed the task successfully. But the task does not end with this. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elf Guild in the Town of Dion</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Sir Kiel Nighthawk</font>. He will be waiting for you with your second task. I pray to Einhasad that you finish all your tasks successfully and get your "wish".
