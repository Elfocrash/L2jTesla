<html><body>Sir Collin Windawood:<br>
Could these actually be the bones of Leon? I heard of his glorious death during the battle against Orcs... What a loss... Never did I expect that I would see you like this, my beloved nephew! I regret I wasn't with you at the moment of your death!<br>
Young Warrior, My family is in your debt. I know it wasn't easy to recover his bones. Thank you so much. Take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Dustin</font>.<br>
Now I shall prepare for my nephew's funeral...
