<html><body>Sir Aron Tanford:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dignity</font> is one of the virtues that define a Knight's worth. Dignity takes various forms in different people...<br>
As we speak there are vicious gangs, who know nothing of dignity, prowling the Wastelands disturbing the residents. These gangs are led by <font color="LEVEL">Herod</font>. He was once a prestigious Knight of Gludio.<br>
During the war against Gracia, Herod was tempted to treason by the enemy's leader. He became an agent of the invaders! Sir Klaus Vasper chased him doggedly and eventually put a spear through his heart. Karol said that 'A Knight who abandons his dignity is as good as dead.' Not wanting to give the traitor the dignity of a funeral, his corpse was left to rot in the Wastelands.<br>
This made his soul become a cursed devil, and the only way to get rid of him is to free him from the curse with this rusty sword. <font color="LEVEL">The skeleton raiders wandering around the Wastelands</font> are his minions. As you destroy the filthy skeleton raiders one by one, you will confront the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit of Herod</font>. Kill him with the rusty sword I gave you, and remind him of the noble dignity of a Gludio Knight. If possible, please bring proof of his end.
