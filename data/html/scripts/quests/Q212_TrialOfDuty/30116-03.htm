<html><body>Priest Dustin:<br>
Last winter a giant horde of blood-thirsty <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orcs</font> swept in from the north and invaded Giran. Those violent thugs looted homes and businesses, and even threatened the castle. They gave the Royal Guards quite a challenge.<br>
Leon Athebaldt led his men in an attack on the Breka Orc encampment. With remarkable courage, they killed the Breka Orc Overlords one by one. Thanks to this effort the Breka Orcs were driven back into the north part of Giran.<br>
The final battle to drive them entirely out of Giran was the fiercest yet. The lone survivor of that battle was Leon's servant. He barely escaped with a shield and weapons inscribed with his master's crest. According to him, Athebaldt fought valiantly to the death, slaying Orcs to his left and right. Eventually he was no match for the hundreds of Orcs that continued to attack in waves against him. His remains have not been found. I'm sure the Breka Orcs have taken them for some nefarious purpose. It saddens me deeply that he cannot be given a proper burial.<br>
