Oh, you got it. Thank you.<br>
My uncle suddenly is saying he wants to build a pastureland in the north. He wishes to become an adventurer to make money for the pastureland.<br>
He says he is not a beginner anymore. But he still worries me... so I hope this might help him a little bit.<br>
And.. It is really hard to ask <font color="LEVEL">since you gave me a Trident</font>, but I have one request.<br>
