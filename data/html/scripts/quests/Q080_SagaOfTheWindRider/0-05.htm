<html><body>Black Cat:<br>
For as long as I can remember, I've been driven by extraordinary dreams! After taking control of the union, I found out about the power of ancient heroes that is now forbidden by the gods.<br>
I knew that I had to possess that power! But all my attempts failed...<br>
My body ruined, I couldn't challenge the power and ended up getting expelled from the union by jealous rivals...<br>
<br>
Filled with disappointment, I fell into despair.<br>
But then, I had an idea! Maybe I can't do it personally, but I can certainly train and send someone on my behalf! Using my brain rather than physical force, and overcoming many political obstacles, I took control of the union! While in that position, I never found the competent person I needed. When I resigned, I was promised by the president of the union that I would be supplied with a competent person!<br>
He seemed credible then, he wasn't so obsessed with his coins at that point...<br>
Are you up to the challenge? Are you willing to risk injuries such as mine, or worse? Are you brave enough to seek the power?<br>
