Oh, really? Maybe he sent the right person this time! My past failures have caused me to ask many people for help... Elena, a spellbook seller, promised to research past challenges to the power for me. She may have some useful information for you.<br>
But, wait...<br>
Elena and I aren't on good terms right now... You must handle her with care... Try to get her in a good mood!<br>
Here's a description of the beast that maimed me. You should read it now. You'll find it useful.<br>
Now, leave and don't come back until you get the power!</body></html>
