This test has two paths. The Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos have long been at war, and both tribes are infamous for their hatred of each other and their cruelty in battle. Select one of the two tribes and obtain from them the Divine Stone of Wisdom. They give that only to those who they consider to be their true friend. Which tribe would you like to choose?<br>
