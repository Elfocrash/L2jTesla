<html><body>Spellbook Seller Elena:<br>
The damned old lady sent you?<br>
Did you come here knowing the relation between the old lady and me?<br>
Yes, we were really close in the past. So I said that I will help to find the method of getting forbidden force from the old documents.<br>
And finally I found the clue for the force. But the old lady complained about my food!<br>
We fought for that reason and never met again.<br>
Sometimes, people like you are deceived by the old lady's trick, and come to me to get some information but never pass my test and go back empty-handed.<br>
