This is heavenly!<br>
Now I'll tell you as promised. According to the old documents, after the battle against the Titans, Einhasad prevented the lower races from getting the power.<br>
However, Gran Kain and Eva secretly sealed part of the power into the tablets and spread them around the world. Maybe they were waiting for someone to discover it.<br>
Here's a Resonance Amulet I found while researching. You need this to get the power of the tablet.<br>
The first tablet is south of the Tower of Insolence. Find it!</body></html>
