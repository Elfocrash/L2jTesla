<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Have you heard that recently the guards and soldiers fought against the medusas in order to protect Giran? They fought with all their might and drove them away, but during the battle many soldiers were infected by the deadly poison of the medusas. If this goes untreated they will all die very soon. And what will happen if the medusas mount another attack? We must find the cure...<br>
Rather, an Antidote to neutralize the medusa's poison. Even the Priests do not know how to make it. However, my old companion <font color="LEVEL">Groot</font> will know how. He was once a medic for the Iron Rose, and we served together on the battlefield for more than 10 years. I heard that he now owns a store in <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Giran</font>. Go and help him make an Antidote.
