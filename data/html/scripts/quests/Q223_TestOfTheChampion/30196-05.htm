We are in trouble! <font color="LEVEL">It turns out to be that the road scavengers that you killed were an instrument of the Leto Lizardmen!</font> Now the lizardmen are planning an attack on Giran Castle! Ascalon must have been right. We must strike the first blow! Many troops are already on their way. Please join them in the fight!<br>
