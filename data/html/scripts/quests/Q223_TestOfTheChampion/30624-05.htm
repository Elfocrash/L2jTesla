<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Things are not so different from the time when I was an active soldier. Perhaps a bit more chaotic and violent. The Blue Shark, the Black Lion, the Storm Blade and the Iron Rose which I belonged to... Many soldiers are battling alien armies in many different locations at the moment. There has never been a time in history when the aliens were so bellicose.<br>
The leaders of each tribe, and the Masters, Magisters and Priests from many other guilds are all complaining that the situation now is very unnatural. All the secret agents from every domain are looking behind the scenes, but for now we have no choice but to face the aliens and destroy them in order to protect ourselves.<br>
I wish to do something useful before I retire. Although I am too weak to participate in the war myself, I shall teach you. While you are taking the test, you must do exactly as you are instructed. Is that clear?<br>
