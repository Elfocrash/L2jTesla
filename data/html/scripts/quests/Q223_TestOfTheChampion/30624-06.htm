<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Good! First you must go and visit my friend <font color="LEVEL">Mason</font>. He is an old comrade of mine. We fought together on the battlefields as part of the Iron Rose. Although he has retired, I am sure he knows more than anyone else about the invaders who are threatening the villagers of Dion. Who knows, he might even get up and head off to the battlefield, inspired by your young spirit...<br>
I heard that Mason, the master of spears, has settled happily with his family <font color="LEVEL">somewhere in southern Dion</font>. If you bring this letter with my seal on it, he will welcome you.
