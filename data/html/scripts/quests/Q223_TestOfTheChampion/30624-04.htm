<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Oops! Aren't you an Orc? You look strong, for sure. Are you a Warrior by any chance? Or perhaps a hired soldier? You remind me of my younger days when I used to work as a hired soldier...<br>
Would you like to hear stories of my splendid past? In my youth I was a soldier of fortune, wandering freely, fighting aliens and making love to women with foreign names. There were some hard times, but my blazing Warrior spirit kept me going. The deep brotherhood among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love, romance, I experienced it all. I was truly a Warrior.<br>
But now I am old. If I could find a talented young fellow to succeed me, I would retire in peace. I can see that you are quite a well-trained Warrior, what do you say? Will you attempt the <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Champion</font>?<br>
