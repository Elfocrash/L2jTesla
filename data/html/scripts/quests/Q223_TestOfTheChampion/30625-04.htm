<html><body>Mason:<br>
I am now too old and weak too even lift a spear. But my hatred towards those who killed my family still boils up like lava. I beg you, please obtain vengeance on my behalf. I will be able to die without regret if you bring me <font color="LEVEL">100 Bloody Axe Heads</font> from the Bloody Axe Elite soldiers.<br>
You will find the Ol Mahums in the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen, in the southern region of Oren</font>. Head north through Death Pass into Giran and you will find their barracks.
