Thank you so much for gathering these ingredients for me. Now I will create the Antidote and deliver it to the temple and the guards. I felt as if I was growing too old to be of any use, but thanks to you I am able to contribute to the defense of my beloved Giran! I am indebted to you... Here is a letter explaining my gratitude. Please take it to <font color="LEVEL">Ascalon</font>.
