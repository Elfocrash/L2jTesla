The <font color="LEVEL">Road Scavengers</font> may not be the great threat to the kingdom that my superior makes them out to be, but they certainly are troublesome. They prey on merchants traveling between Oren and Giran.<br>
Your orders are to wipe out those troublesome thieves. Go to <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass</font> and slay all you find. But watch out for surprise attacks! If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">100 Road Scavenger heads</font>, I will write a letter commending you for your service to the kingdom. That will surely help advance your career...
