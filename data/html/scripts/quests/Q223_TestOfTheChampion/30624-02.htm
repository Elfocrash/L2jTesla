<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Would you like to hear stories of my splendid past? In my youth I was a soldier of fortune, wandering freely, fighting aliens and making love to women with foreign names. There were some hard times, but my blazing warrior spirit kept me going. The deep brotherhood among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love, romance, I experienced it all. I was truly a warrior.<br>
But now I am old. If I could find a talented young person to succeed me, I would retire in peace. If only you could enhance your skills a bit, you could be the one to succeed me. What do you think? Please come back to me after you have improved your skills.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
