<html><body>Captain Mouen:<br>
Ascalon was my teacher when I was young. At one time he was a good soldier, but now he is very old and his mind wanders. Age has begun to tell on him... But he is like a father to me, and I won't go against what he says. Nowadays he seems to be suffering from the delusion that only he can save the kingdom from destruction. I am very worried about him...<br>
