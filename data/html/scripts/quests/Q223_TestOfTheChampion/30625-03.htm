<html><body>Mason:<br>
I want to rip apart the soldiers of Gracia's Foreign Legion still in our kingdom! Ah, but I am too old now to pick up the sword of revenge alone.<br>
Here, take the ring I once wore as a mercenary. Put it on and obtain vengeance on my behalf. Slay all the <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Axe Elites</font> that killed my beloved family. Go north through Death Pass into Giran and you will find their barracks. The Ol Mahums are in the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen</font>.<br>
Bring me at least <font color="LEVEL">100</font> Bloody Axe Heads and I'll begin to sleep easier.
