<html><body>Veteran Ascalon:<br>
Before doing anything else, go meet my friend <font color="LEVEL">Mason</font>. He is from Iron Rose, just like me, and has fought beside me in many battles. That was long ago, of course, and the most action he probably sees now is chopping wood for his cooking fire. But even if his spear-arm is weaker and his belly broader, he still knows more about the races that threaten the Dion villagers than anyone. And who knows? Perhaps your youthful enthusiasm will even motivate him to take his spear from its place above his hearth and again venture onto the field of battle. He was a master of the spear in his day, you know...<br>
I heard long ago that he settled <font color="LEVEL">somewhere in southern Dion</font> with his wife and family. If you show him this letter with my signet, I'm sure he will welcome you.<br>
Finally, please accept this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font> as my gift. You can trade it for something special from the village gatekeeper. I hope it will help you on your journey.
