Hmm...what does this say? 'Perform the ritual at the Obelisk of Shilen'.. I think they took the girl to <font color="LEVEL">the obelisk in the Dark Forest.</font> Then the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elves</font> are involved in this case? Curse them! There are many obelisks in the Dark Forest... We can't figure out which obelisk they are at with only this?!<br>
In any case, we have to track them as soon as possible. We must save the holy maiden before she becomes sacrificed. I am a Dwarf and slow on my feet, so you should leave first. I will send swift supporters to aid you, so hurry! They must be going to a place with an altar...! I will inform Sorius about the situation.
