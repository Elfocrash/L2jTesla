I don't like the way this is looking. I must send a guard to protect the child immediately. And I must report this to the High Priest at once!<br>
Master Sorius has told me of your great contribution to this effort. He was very complimentary of your skills.<br>
There may come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep your skills sharp for that day.<br>
