<html><body>Priest Bandellos:<br>
An ancient prophecy says that one day, when darkness fills the world as water does a bowl, and the groaning of the people can be heard in the rocks of the land itself, there will be born a girl-child, sent by Einhasad, who will cleanse the world.<br>
Now comes word that the long-awaited one may have finally arrived, a girl who <font color="LEVEL">claims that she is the very one mentioned in the prophecy</font>. We must determine the truth of that claim.<br>
Your task is to investigate this matter in detail.<br>
First, visit <font color="LEVEL">Perrin in Gludin Village</font>, who is currently protecting this supposed "saint."<br>
Before you go, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
