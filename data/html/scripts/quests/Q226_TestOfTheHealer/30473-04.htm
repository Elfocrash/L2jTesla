<html><body>Priest Bandellos:<br>
There is a very old prophecy that says a day will come when all the people of this world will suffer under an overwhelming dark energy. In those days a girl will be born, a perfect representative of Einhasad, sent to purify this wicked world.<br>
And now a child is born, a <font color="LEVEL">girl who claims to be the One</font>. Whether she is authentic or not, the church cannot ignore this.<br>
You must examine this matter carefully. This shall be your test.<br>
You must go and see <font color="LEVEL">Perrin at the Gludin Harbor</font>. He is said to be protecting the holy child.
