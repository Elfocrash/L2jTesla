<html><body>Mysterious Dark Elf:<br>
I carry out the will of Shilen. Those who dare to stand in my way will be brought down with no mercy!<br>
I knew that you were tracking me... I suppose you are in the middle of the examination. So, does your future depend on capturing me? Ha! Who do I have to thank for this honor?<br>
Sorry to say, but this is a matter of life and death for me as well. I won't make things too easy for you.<br>
Soldiers, kill this man!
