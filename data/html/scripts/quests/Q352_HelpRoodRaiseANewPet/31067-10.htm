<html><body>Pet Manager Rood:<br>
Oh, wonderful! Do you remember what I said earlier? Let me explain it again.<br>
Lienriks are mainly found in the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Silence</font>. You will see <font color="LEVEL">lienriks</font> and <font color="LEVEL">lienrik lads</font>. One attacks from a distance and the other attacks by spitting poison. Especially beware of this one.<br>
Anyway, both types lay <font color="LEVEL">eggs</font>. The gender of the lienrik is obvious, even when it is in egg form.<br>
I am but a poor pet manager, but I will reward you for any eggs you bring me, the more the better.
