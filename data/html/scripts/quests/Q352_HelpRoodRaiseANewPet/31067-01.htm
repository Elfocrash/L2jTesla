Have you ever seen a lienrik? It inhabits the Field of Silence. It's so cute... you wouldn't have forgotten it! Don't you want to catch one and take it home?<br>
Since it flies in the air, it never gets dirty. And its coloring is spectacular! When you stroke it, it feels cool and moist... A most incredibly pleasant sensation, if you know what I mean...<br>
Those fools who like warm and fuzzy animals don't know what they're missing. The lienrik possesses true beauty and dignity...<br>
