Have you ever seen a lienrik? It inhabits the Field of Silence. It's so cute... you wouldn't have forgotten it! Do you want to catch one and take it home?<br>
You might not yet realize how much fun it can be. You should come back later.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
