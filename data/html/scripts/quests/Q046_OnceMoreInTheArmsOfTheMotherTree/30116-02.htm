Ah, you're from the boutique shop! Excellent timing, I just finished Mr. Galladucci's order!<br>
That curse was very powerful, and I had to ask several priests to help me remove it! I can't believe he was able to hold onto that thing the way it was! Well, now it's been completely purified and made safe.<br>
Here it is! Please deliver this necklace to Mr. Galladucci at the boutique shop. May the tranquility of Einhasad be with you always!
