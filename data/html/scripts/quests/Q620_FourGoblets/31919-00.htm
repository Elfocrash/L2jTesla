<html><body>Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:<br>
I teleport travelers to the Imperial Tomb. Only those who have visited the Four Sepulchers in the past may go there.<br>
To teleport, the traveler must carry a used pass for the sepulcher. I can also teleport those who possess any document that proves that they are directly connected to the Imperial Tomb.
