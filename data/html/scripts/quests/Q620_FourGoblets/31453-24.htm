<html><body>Nameless Spirit:<br>
When it is time for the party to leave the sepulcher, they are sent to the Pilgrim's Temple. You must defeat the shadow of Halisha before the next entry time.<br>
The sepulcher has several interconnected rooms, and you must find keys to open the locked doors. You can get the keys from evil creatures that appear when you open a suspicious box. Doors close periodically, so you'd better use them while they're open!<br>
You'll find the shadows of Halisha in one of the rooms.<br>
