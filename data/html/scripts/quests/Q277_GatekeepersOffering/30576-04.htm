That is not enough at all. <font color="LEVEL">I need at least twenty starstones.</font> If I can't offer them to the totem spirit of the spider, the door of space and time that connects our village to the mainland will be closed! So please hurry.<br>
Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">graystone golems</font> on the Immortal Plateau to obtain starstones. Be careful! They may be slow, but they are very strong and are hardly a force to be taken lightly. I will pray for your safe return!
