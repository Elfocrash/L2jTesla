Thank you! I will not forget your kindness. But are you sure you know what is required? Every golem carries a <font color="LEVEL">starstone</font> in its body. According to the Seers, the power of the stars contained within the starstone is the force that keeps the golems alive and moving.<br>
Anyway, if you defeat <font color="LEVEL">the graystone golems</font> on the Immortal Plateau, you will be able to collect the precious mineral that I need. I need <font color="LEVEL">twenty</font> of those.<br>
Be careful! The graystone golem may be slow, but its strength is great. You are placing yourself in great danger, so proceed with caution!
