<html><body>Seer Reva:<br>
Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels and demons. I trust that you have recovered many of the <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Ash Urns</font> from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Porcelain</font> you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either sell it at a store or take it to <font color="LEVEL">antique dealer Patrin</font>! He is at the general store in Oren Castle Town.<br>
