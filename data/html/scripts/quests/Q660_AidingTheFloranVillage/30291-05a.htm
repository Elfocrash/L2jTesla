Eh? I fear you've made a mistake, folks; your work's not done. There's nothing to fight standing here, so you'd best head out to the Floran Agricultural Area. Go on, kill what needs killing, and don't forget - bring me the Watching Eyes, a Roughly Hewn Rock Golem Shard and a Delu Lizardman Scale to earn your reward.
