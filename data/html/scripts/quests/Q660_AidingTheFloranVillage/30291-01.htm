<html><body>Captain Alex:<br>
We've been having problems in Floran with monsters violating our perimeter. There have been a few skirmishes with our militia, but even worse than that, some monsters have gotten past our sentries and attacked citizens. I'm embarrassed to admit that - it's our job to keep this community safe, but we're just spread too darn thin! Reports indicate the monsters are targeting farmers out plowing their fields. I'm telling you this because I'd like your help in dealing with these monsters. If we can stop them, it'd go a long way toward restoring peace and order in Floran Village. Will you help us?<br>
