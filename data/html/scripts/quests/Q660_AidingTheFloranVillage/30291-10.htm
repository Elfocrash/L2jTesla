<html><body>Captain Alex:<br>
Well, you've seen the area, and you well know we can't be protected by the lord's army. We've formed a citizen militia, but it's done us precious little good. Myself aside, most of our farmers barely know which end of a knife to hold, and not a sword among them. They're helpless against the vicious monsters that plague us.<br>
I'd normally hire adventurers to help us, but we can't afford the gold to pay anyone experienced enough to do it for money, and we're not exactly being overwhelmed with volunteers. So we fight, and we die, and the village chief's face grows longer with every funeral he has to attend.<br>
The chief wants to hold a memorial service for the victims. Nothing fancy, but with the losses we've suffered, we'd need five hundred monster sacrifices to put the victims' souls to rest. I have no idea where we'll get them.<br>
