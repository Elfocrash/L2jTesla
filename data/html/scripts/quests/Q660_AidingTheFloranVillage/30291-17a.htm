So, you're off to other adventures? Very well, but... I see you have proof of completing the quest. I can offer you a reward for it, although I'm sure it won't be of any other use to you. Let's make that trade now, shall we?<br>
Thank you, and here's your reward. Good luck in your travels, and don't forget us here in Floran. Our doors are always open to you!
