Ha! I'll be honest - I was hoping for someone of your caliber to step forward. Here's the situation: we have a major problem with monster incursions in <font color="LEVEL">the Floran Agricultural Area</font>. They've been killing innocent citizens, and we can't have that. I'll need proof of your kills, of course. No offense, but I can't pay out a reward unless I'm sure it's done. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">the Watching Eyes, a Golem Shard and a Delu Lizardman Scale</font>, and I'll gladly pay you.<br>
Good hunting! We're counting on you.
