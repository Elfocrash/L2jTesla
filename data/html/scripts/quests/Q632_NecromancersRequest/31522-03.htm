The most important of the materials I need are undead hearts with their Human memory intact.<br>
Especially the grey heart of undead vampires. They're just as good as red cloth from Aden. I need 200 of them.<br>
Also, I'll trade you something for undead brains. You can hunt them at night. What do you think?
