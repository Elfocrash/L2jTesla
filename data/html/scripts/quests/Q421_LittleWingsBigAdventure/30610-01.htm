<html><body>Elder Cronos:<br>
We've had this conversation about hatchlings before, haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchling requires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet. But you wouldn't listen, oh no... So here we are... Have you learned anything? Since you are determined to keep it, you should prepare yourself to be the master of a strider. Hone your skills and come back to see me.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 45 and above.)
