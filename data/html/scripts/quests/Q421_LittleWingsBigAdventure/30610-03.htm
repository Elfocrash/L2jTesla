We've had this conversation about hatchlings before, haven't we, my young friend? As I said before, raising a hatchling requires resolve, which you haven't proven to me yet. But you wouldn't listen, oh no... So here we are... Have you learned anything? Since you are determined to keep it, you should prepare it to be a strider. That cute little fellow isn't ready yet, though!<br>
(Only a hatchling of level 55 or above can transform into a strider.)
