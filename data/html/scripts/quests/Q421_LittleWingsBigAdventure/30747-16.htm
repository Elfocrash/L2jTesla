Give me the dragon flute. Your strider will no longer respond to it. You must now use this to call him.<br>
Although your pet looks very different now, if you just continue to give it the love and attention you did before, you will get along fine. Someday he will likely trust you enough to take you flying on his back. There's something to look forward to!
