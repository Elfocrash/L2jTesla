Why have you come back so soon? Your hatchling has not had enough sap! Surely you don't think that someone else will do your job for you? Go now and deal with your responsibilities!<br>
Remember, your hatchling must drink the sap of the <font color="LEVEL">four fairy trees in the forest south of Aden Castle Town</font>. <font color="LEVEL">You mustn't touch the sap of the tree as it is a deadly poison to your race. Your hatchling must feed himself!</font> Beware the <font color="LEVEL">ghosts that guard the fairy trees</font>!
