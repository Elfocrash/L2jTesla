<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br>
Long ago, when I still had a complete body, my 1000 eyes told me everything that occurred in the world. It was I who told Einhasad of the relationship between Shilen and Gran Kain. When Eva abdicated as the goddess of water and went into hiding, it was I who exposed her.<br>
But with the creation of the four races, the world became much too complex for me to watch everything that happened. I began opening only 500 of my eyes per day. This led to a sharp division within my personality.<br>
Half of my mind concentrated on darker events in the world - war, murder, betrayal and corruption. This part of my mind became dark and depressed, and longed to purge the rampant evil from the world.<br>
The other half of my mind focused on the brighter side of the world - love, art, courage and fealty. This part of my personality fell in love with all the noble things in the world.<br>
During the brutal war between gods and giants, I refused to disclose the hiding places of giants. Einhasad responded by ripping my body into pieces and pulling out my eyes! She then threw my remains into this valley. Slowly, my two largest eyes became aware of light and darkness. I am the eye that is conscious of light.<br>
Daimon the White-Eyed inherited the dark world view of Argos. He's determined to purify this world, and has brainwashed the monsters of this valley to help him realize his goal.<br>
Brave warrior! Help stop Daimon!<br>
