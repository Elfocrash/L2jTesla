<html><body>Guard Praga:<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad Temple near the northern entrance of the village</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font>. Take the <font color="LEVEL">report</font> to him. He'll give you a new assignment.<br>
His speech is somewhat peculiar, but he's the top expert in the village, so treat him with respect and don't upset him!<br>
