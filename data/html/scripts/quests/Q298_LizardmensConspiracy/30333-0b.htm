<html><body>Guard Praga:<br>
As you may know, the <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardman stronghold</font> is in the west part of Gludio Castle Town.<br>
During the war with Grecia, they infiltrated our land through a gap in our security, and our guards have been unable to drive them out since. An interesting report about them has recently surfaced, and Magister Rohmer is investigating the matter.<br>
He's hopeful that this new intelligence will allow us to destroy the Lizardman forces soon. He's looking for someone to help him with this mission.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 25 and above.)
