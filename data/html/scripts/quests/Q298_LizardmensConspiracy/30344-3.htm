<html><body>Magister Rohmer:<br>
I, Rohmer, thank you for your help. Now, I can weaken the power of the Maille Lizardmen's magic even further.<br>
But the fight is not over yet. The Maille Lizardmen outnumber us and have countless shamans. They will endlessly try to strengthen and recover their magic. To prevent this, we must continuously offset this magic. I hope that you can help us again in the future.<br>
I, Rohmer, cannot compensate your efforts with wealth or materials, but I'll at least try to make your future path easier.<br><br>
(This quest is a repeatable quest. You can start it again through Guard Praga.)
