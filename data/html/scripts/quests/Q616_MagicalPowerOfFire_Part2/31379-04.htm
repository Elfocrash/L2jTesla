<html><body>Soul Guide Udan Mardui:<br>
Excellent. Varka's friend. What you have to do from now on, it's to break into Ketra Orc Outpost and find the Holy Altar. The Holy Altar is hidden in a deep place of Ketra Orc Outpost. First, go to the Holy Altar with this Red Totem. Then, use this Red Totem there and conjure Soul of Fire Nastron which breathes power into Asefa. And then, defeat the appeared Nastron and bring the heart of Flame to Udan Mardui, which is the linkingpin with Asefa. That is your task.
