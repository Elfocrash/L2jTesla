Good. Go into the forest and strike down any <font color="LEVEL">imp</font> you meet, collect the <font color="LEVEL">shackles</font> around their necks, and bring them to me. I will compensate you for every shackle you bring me.<br>
In the name of the goddess, may your hunt meet great success! Soon those arrogant imps will once again call us their masters!
