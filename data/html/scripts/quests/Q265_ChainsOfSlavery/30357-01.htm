<html><body>Sentry Kristin:<br>
Have you ever seen imps in the forest? Those hideous creatures were once slaves that served our race. However, they undid the spells of restraint through some unknown method and escaped aboveground. When I look at that lowly race that used to serve us parading around aboveground, I feel so... I cannot contain my hurt pride.<br>
However, recently Tetrarch Vellior said he is preparing a spell that will make the imps submissive again. Soon, those rude imps will once again call us their masters!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 6 and above.)
