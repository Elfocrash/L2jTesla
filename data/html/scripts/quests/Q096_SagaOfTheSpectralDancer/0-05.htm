No, that's not it. I called you because I want to to conduct an investigation into an ancient document. <font color="LEVEL">Elena, a spellbook seller in Goddard Castle Town</font>, is very fluent in ancient languages. I've asked her to dicipher the ancient document. Go to her and find out what she's discovered... If what they say about the forbidden power is true, we should reclaim it, don't you think?<br>
Will you do it?<br>
