<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br>
Even after my friends, the giants, perished, and the gods tore my body asunder and imprisoned me here, I stayed quiet.<br>
Now, to add insult to injury, they've posted their disciples as guards to watch over me, to humiliate what's left of me! I can't stand it any more!<br>
I'm not as evil as you the children of the world think.<br>
On the contrary, I love peace!<br>
I beseech you! If I attack the guards I'll be severely tortured!<br>
Would you and your soldiers help me?<br>
