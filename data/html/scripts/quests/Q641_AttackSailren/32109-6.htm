The number of items is incorrect. Listen carefully!<br>
You will encounter predatory dinosaurs such as <font color="LEVEL">Velociraptor and Pterosaur</font>. They are not as strong as Sailren, but vicious nevertheless. These are the most likely to contain the fragments. Go and hunt them -- find the fragments! Remember, you must return with at least <font color="LEVEL">30</font> fragments. If you bring me 30 fragments or more, I will reforge them into an intact axe head. Ah, could our deliverance finally be at hand?<br>
May Shilen help you strike true!
