<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
Ah? So, the dinosaurs themselves contain some fragments of Gazkh?<br>
I suppose that it is possible...if the axe was broken and the fragments were scattered by the force Shilen used to seal Sailren.<br>
The predator dinosaurs here have skin harder than iron -- I doubt they would ever feel the fragments embedded in their hides. In fact, the very power of Gazkh has probably greatly extended their lifespans.<br>
You who contain an ancient Elrokian spirit, you are the only one who can hunt those dinosaurs and bring back the Gazkh fragments.<br>
Choose now. Will you attempt to recover the fragments?<br>
