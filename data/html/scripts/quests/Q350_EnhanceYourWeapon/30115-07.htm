The collection of a soul doesn't always go as planned. Some evil souls will simply not be absorbed, and, if you happen to collect the wrong soul, the crystal will shatter...<br>
Soul crystals develop refined tastes, and will reject weaker souls after a while. When this happens you must seek the souls of creatures of greater evil to satisfy your crystal.<br>
Remember that you may not absorb a soul with more than one crystal because a resonance effect is created between the crystals that prevents proper absorbtion.<br>
