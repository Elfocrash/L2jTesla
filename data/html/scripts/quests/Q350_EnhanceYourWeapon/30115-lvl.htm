<html><body>Grand Magister Jurek:<br>
Recently I have had troubling premonitions. The trees, birds and fish know of what I speak. I still don't know what is coming, only that it will be horrible. I hope I am wrong...<br>
I hope, at the least, to save humanity. I am therefore recruiting like-minded individuals to prepare for whatever awaits us. If only I knew how much time we have left!<br>
