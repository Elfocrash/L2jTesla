It seems that the most evil creatures in the Lair of Antharas are the <FONT COLOR=LEVEL>Malruk Knights, Malruk Berserkers, Malruk Lords, Limal Karinness, Kariks, Pytans, and Pytan Knights.</FONT><br>
Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
