It seems that the most evil creatures in the Devastated Castle are the <FONT COLOR=LEVEL>Doom Servants, Doom Guards, Doom Archers, Doom Troopers, Doom Warriors, and Doom Knights.</FONT><br>
Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
