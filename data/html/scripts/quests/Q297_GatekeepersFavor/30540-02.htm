<html><body>Gatekeeper Wirphy:<br>
Most of my body parts were created by combining materials from the previous creations of the ancient giants.<br>
But because the remains are not complete, I can always feel energy draining out of my body. My body could not be perfected with Dwarven technology, so they opted for a second choice -- rechargeable energy.<br>
But I used too much energy while recently teleporting a large group of traders. Will you help me?<br>
