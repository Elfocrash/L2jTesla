Thank you!<br>
You are truly kind.<br>
While travelling through the Spine Mine Field, you will see many <font color="LEVEL">whinstone golems</font>, one of the legacies of the ancient giants, wandering around. Please collect <font color="LEVEL">twenty Starstones</font> from their bodies. That should be enough energy for now.<br>
I don't have much, but I can give you a <font color="LEVEL">gatekeeper's token</font> that lets you use the teleport service.<br>
Good luck then!
