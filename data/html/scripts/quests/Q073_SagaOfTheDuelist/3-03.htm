Just killing won't win you a stone.<br>
First, you must go to the Varka Silenos stronghold and meet with Naran Ashanuk, their messenger. He'll help you to form an alliance with them.<br>
You must win their trust by proving yourself in battle.<br>
Or, if you want, you can approach the Ketra Orcs.</body></html>
