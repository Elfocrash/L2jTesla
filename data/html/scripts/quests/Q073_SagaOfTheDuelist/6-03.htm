<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.<br>
A series of visions appear... Of an ancient Sword Master named Iron who aspired to become a Duelist, and eventually sold his soul to a demon.<br>
Now he stands before the monument to prevent any other Duelist from challenging his power.<br>
You'll find him at the southeast corner of the Ketra Orc Outpost.</body></html>
