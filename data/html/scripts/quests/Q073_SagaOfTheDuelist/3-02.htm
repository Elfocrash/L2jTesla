<html><body>Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Killing alone won't win you a stone.<br>
First, go to the Ketra Orcs advance base and meet with Wahkan, Messenger of Ketra. He'll help you form an alliance.<br>
Fight hard alongside them to win their trust.<br>
Or you could change your mind and fight for the Varka Silenos, I don't care!</body></html>
