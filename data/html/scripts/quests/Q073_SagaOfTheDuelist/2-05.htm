Okay. First you must go to Goddard and get the <font color="LEVEL">gourmet meal</font> that was eaten by the Duelists before competitions and bring it to me. There's a great chef there who can make it for you. I think his name was Donath or something.<br>
 Bring it to me, I'll tell you everything I know about Duelists.</body></html>
