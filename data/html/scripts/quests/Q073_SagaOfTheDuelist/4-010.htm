I see you're making the Pilgrimage of the Duelist!<br>
I've heard that what is written on the stone tablet isn't that important! You should try your best every time you fight. Think of every strike as your last...<br>
That sort of thinking produces miracles!<br>
Well, I must be going... Here, take this last Resonance Amulet. I don't need it. You can probably put it to good use. Good luck!<br>
