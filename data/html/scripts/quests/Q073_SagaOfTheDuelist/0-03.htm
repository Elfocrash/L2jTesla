<html><body>Grand Master Sedrick:<br>
 He's watched the games for generations!<br>
 He says that only a <font color="LEVEL">warrior who seeks to venture beyond the horizon</font> will understand him. If you knew Iron's history, you'd understand...<br>

See the <font color="LEVEL">Arena Manager at the Coliseum</font> to find out more. He's the one who's pursuing this issue!<br>
Take this document about Iron to him. I'm curious to find out what he thinks.</body></html>
