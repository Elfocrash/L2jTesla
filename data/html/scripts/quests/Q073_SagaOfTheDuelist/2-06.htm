Iron... He was truly a master swordsman, but he never managed to become a Duelist.<br>
 While on his pilgrimage, he obtained a mysterious power. He was able to defeat all opponents without even breaking a sweat.<br>
And then suddenly, he disappeared! From that day on, there were no more Duelists named... Grand Master Sedrick tried... He selected a few candidates whose skills were about equal to yours, and was about to name them all Duelists! I put a stop to that!<br>
 Now, take this Stone of Pilgrimage! You'll need it to earn the title of Duelist. Take it to the Resonance Amulet south of the Ivory Tower.<br>
You'll find what it truly means to be a Duelist.</body></html>
