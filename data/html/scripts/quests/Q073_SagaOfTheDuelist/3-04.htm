 Have you forgotten what you need to do?<br>
You shouldn't doubt your abilities!<br>
Or did you really forget where to go? To help the Ketra Orcs, go to their advance base in the northern part of Goddard Castle Town and meet their messenger Wahkan.<br>
To help the Varka Silenos, go to their stronghold in the western part of Goddard Castle Town and meet with Naran Ashanuk, their messenger.</body></html>
