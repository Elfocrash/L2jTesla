<html><body>Master Chef Donath:<br>
 First, bring me some meat! Umm... The pastureland of Rune would be a good place to start. Speak with the beast herder. Make sure you get a piece of <font color="LEVEL">Top Quality Meat</font>! Oh, you can't just come out and ask him for it either! The guy's a real jerk! You should offer to deliver some of his meat to the village, and then steal a piece of it!<br>
 I'll also need an <font color="LEVEL">ice crystal</font>. I need it to sterilize the meat and preserve it. You can get one from <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font>. He's nearby. He'll most likely ask you to do him a favor in exchange.<br>
After you get both ingredients, bring them to me. I'll start getting ready.</body></html>
