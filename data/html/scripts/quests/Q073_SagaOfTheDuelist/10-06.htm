<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. It seems that I heard someone laughing.<br>
The man said. "One more hero you wanted is born here again."<br>
A lady with blue clothes answered. "No, he is just a baby who starts toddling. But, he won't be raised under his mother's protection anymore."<br>
You are right. Defeat is Mother of Victory. I forgot this natural truth for such a long time, didn't I?<br>
What you can get something from Victory, that's because you staked your own life and resolution on it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Can the Victory without losing anything be called Victory...?<br>
To fight by staking everything in any fighting at any time. The resolution is the mark of a Duelist!<br>
Now, go back to Grand Master Sedrick of Aden Castle Town, and finish the pilgrimage.</body></html>
