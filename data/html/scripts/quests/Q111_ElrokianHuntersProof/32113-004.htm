Hmmm, perhaps this will help you forge a bond with the Elrokians... During my explorations of the island, I was gravely wounded -- if not for Mushika, I would have died. He took me back to the Elrokian village, where I stayed while I recovered.<br>
During my time there, I heard of a song called the <font color="LEVEL">"Warrior's Song"</font> that supposedly contains all the Elroki tribe's pride, pain and sadness.<br>
They sing this song in both victory and mourning.<br>
If you can learn the song and its meaning, perhaps you can earn the tribe's trust...<br>
