Ah, the practice device needed to learn this skill! Only Asamah could have made it; clearly he has accepted your hand in friendship, though you are an outsider.<br>
I'll teach you; listen carefully.<br>
When you have the trap in your hand, you can use 3 types of skills.<br>
You can only use capture skill on the powerful dinosaur, <font color="LEVEL">Tyrannosaurus.</font> You must use <font color="LEVEL">Kabokula,</font> the first among the 3 skills, to put the dinosaur in a captive state.<br>
To maintain that captive state, however, you must use the appropriate skill for counteracting one of the Tyrannosaurus' 3 kinds of reactions. You will learn when to use which skill through experience.<br>
Whenever you use the 3 types of skills, you will consume a capture stone; therefore, you should prepare enough capture stones for your task.<br>
Now I have told you everything I know...<br>
Your practice device is now useless, so I will take it...<br>
In its place, take this real device and these capture stones. After you have used all the capture stones, buy more from <font color="LEVEL">Asamah.</font><br>
If you lose the device, you may buy another from Asamah -- but take care not to lose it, outsider!<br>
May it brin success in battle and glory in the annals of our tribe!
