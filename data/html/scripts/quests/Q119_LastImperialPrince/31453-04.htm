Thank you! Honestly, I heard from an adventurer who stopped by that <font color="LEVEL">Nurse Devorin</font> is still alive in <font color="LEVEL">Rune Township</font>! If you don't mind, would you go meet with her and learn the <font color="LEVEL">lyrics of the lullaby</font>? If you show Nurse Devorin the Antique Brooch, she'll know I sent you. Please, help me!
