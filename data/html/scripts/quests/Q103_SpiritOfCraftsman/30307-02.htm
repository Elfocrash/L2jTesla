<html><body>Blacksmith Karrod:<br>
In a few days, the shipment of Oriharukon Ore that I ordered from the Dwarves in Giran will be arriving. Tetrarch Thifiell has commissioned me to make Oriharukon blades. But I am worried that I may not be able to make a blade good enough to satisfy the Tetrarch, as I am still unskilled in handling oriharukon metals. As soon as the oriharukon is delivered, I will start looking for ways to handle the metal. I may require your assistance then.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 11 and above.)
