 You've learned the ultimate sacred truths of absolute geometry! My only role is to confer an appropriate title upon the person with the knowledge.<br>
On behalf of the Black Anvil Guild, I hereby grant you the title of Maestro!<br>
Congratulations! The birth of a new Maestro is a very happy occasion! I expect great things from you! Please do your best to become a model for all Dwarves!</body></html>
