As you can see, the problem isn't my skill, only the shortage of raw materials! I fixed it, didn't I? Take it to <font color="LEVEL">Master Tobald</font> now. Wilma #3 is working fine!<br>
 I heard you were on the pilgrimage of the tablets. I didn't realize you were so important! Good luck! May you become as great a craftsman as Master Tobald himself!</body></html>
