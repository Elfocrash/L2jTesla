 You should meet Master Tobald first and ask him about the pilgrimage of tablets. He's probably in <font color="LEVEL">Goddard Castle Town</font> by now. He, like his brother, tends to show up unexpectedly and then vanish just as suddenly... So, I'm not quite sure.<br>
You must read the report I gave you! You'll need to know what's in it! Get going now! Good luck!</body></html>
