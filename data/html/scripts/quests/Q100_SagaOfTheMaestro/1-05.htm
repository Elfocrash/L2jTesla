Ha! I'm embarrassed to say, but that's what happened. Honestly, I need a very powerful coolant to repair such a huge cooling system... Could you please find some <font color="LEVEL">ice crystals</font> for me? I've heard they reach a temperature of absolute zero! You can only find them in the <font color="LEVEL">hot springs area</font> in the northern part of Goddard. <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font> will tell you where to find them if you help him find some soy sauce.</body></html>
