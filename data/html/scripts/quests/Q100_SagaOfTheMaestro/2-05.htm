I don't know! I need to bring a few things to help you with the pilgrimage. We'll need to fix my Wilma #3. Can you help me out? Then you'll find the first Tablet of Vision! Cheer up! You'll do great work in the future. Please be careful!<br>
I asked my student, <font color="LEVEL">Blueprint Seller Borodin</font>, to repair the cooling system of Wilma #3, but something went wrong. I'm sure you can quickly find the problem. Please do this for me!</body></html>
