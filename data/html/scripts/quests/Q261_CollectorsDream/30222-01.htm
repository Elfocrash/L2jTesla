Lately I've put aside the money lending business and have taken up the hobby of collecting the skins or claws of rare animals. There are many that criticize my hobby, saying that only Humans would gather the bodies of dead animals as trophies, but these are the same people that turn around and come to see or borrow them for a few days, saying that they need them for magic research -- of course, asking me to keep it a secret from everyone else.<br>
One day, when you become skilled enough to hunt rare animals, stop by and see me. I will give you a rewarding task to complete. Right now, though, I think it would be far too difficult for you.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 15 and above.)
