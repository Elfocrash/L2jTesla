Lately I've put aside the money lending business and have taken up the hobby of collecting the skins or claws of rare animals. There are many that criticize my hobby, saying that only Humans would gather the bodies of dead animals as trophies, but these are the same people that turn around and come to see or borrow them for a few days, saying that they need them for magic research -- of course, asking me to keep it a secret from everyone else.<br>
So how about it, will you take on a job for me? It involves searching the fields and hunting rare animals for trophies. I can't say it's an easy task, but I will compensate you generously for your labor. What do you say, would you like to give it a try?<br>
