<html><body>Mercenary Captain Pierce:<br>
You'll find two types of stakatos in the Swamp of Screams, Splinter Stakatos around the edges and Needle Stakatos at the center. There are many poisonous pools that they hang around, so beware.<br>
When you kill one, pull out its claws. Collect 100 on each outing, they serve as proof of your deeds.<br>
Your life is most important, so don't get in over your head.
