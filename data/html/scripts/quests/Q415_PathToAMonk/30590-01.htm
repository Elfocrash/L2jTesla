It's a fledgling sent by Gantaki! How dare you disturb my meditation ...<br>
I don't want to associate with someone with no skill! Go catch the <font color="LEVEL">kasha bear</font> with your bare hands! Then, pull out five claws and bring them back in this pouch! Until you finish this task, don't think of coming back!<br>
And take heed! If you use any other weapon besides your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons, you are disqualified! A true monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
