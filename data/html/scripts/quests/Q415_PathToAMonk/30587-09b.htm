Ah, Khavatari Aren... That name has been almost forgotten for many years now.<br>
Not only did she teach Prefect Kasman, but Flame Successor Akkan as well. But she went into seclusion a long time ago, and Khavatari Hubai took her place.<br>
Khavatari Aren lives as a hermit near the Valley of the Lords. I don't know why she chose such a place, but if you seek her out she may still be willing to help you.
