To complete the Trial of Steel, you must fight against fighters of various races. The opponents you must knock down are the <font color="LEVEL">Vuku Orc Fighter, ratman warrior, Langk Lizardman Warrior, and Felim warrior</font>. Come back after you have collected three tokens from each race, for a total of 12 tokens.<br>
And, don't forget, you must not use any weapon during the trial other than your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons. A true Monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
