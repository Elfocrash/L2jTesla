Very well. I will attend to matters here. Go and exercise your Kabart skills on the Kasha Blade Spiders and Kasha Fang Spiders you find. If you kill them and bring back 6 of their fangs, I will accept this as a demonstration of your skill.<br>
You must fight them using only Kabart. Use no sword, spear or axe. Mark this well: if you use a weapon to obtain the fangs, I will know.
