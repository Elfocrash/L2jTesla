Very good! I haven't seen one with your guts in a long time. Actually, I have nothing to teach you that you have not already taught yourself. The flame stands for strong faith that wishes to become stronger and a fiery desire to achieve victory.<br>
I was testing whether you had the heart to abandon all desires and walk the path of the Monk who pursues only strength. This is the meaning of the Trial of Flame.<br>
Now take this! The Fiery Spirit Scroll! Take it and this letter and go back to <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu</font>.
