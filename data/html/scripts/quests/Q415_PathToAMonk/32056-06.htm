<html><body>Khavatari Aren:<br>
There are creatures called <font color="LEVEL">Baar Dre Vanul who live south of the Immortal Plateau</font>. A Necromancer called them forth. If you defeat them and bring their horns to me, you will have proven your worth to be a monk.<br>
And yes, once again, you must <font color="LEVEL">fight using only Kabart. If you depend on weapons instead of your own skill, the path to Kabart will remain closed to you.</font>
