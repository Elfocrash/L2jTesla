Tejakar Oroka! Good work, young fighter! As a result of steady effort and steadfast perseverance, you have obtained both scrolls! Congratulations! Maintain that spirit and go forward. I hope you will become a fighter stronger than anyone else!<br>
Take this totem! It is a token that shows that you have earned the rights and passed the Trial of Flame and Iron to become a Monk. Take this to the high prefect. He will change your profession to Monk.
