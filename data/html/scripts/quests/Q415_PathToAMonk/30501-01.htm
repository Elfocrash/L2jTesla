To find the second scroll needed in order to become a Monk, you must meet <font color="LEVEL">Khavatari Toruku</font>. To meet him, you must follow the path that heads north from the village. He will be near the fork in the road. When you meet him, give him this fig.<br>
Come back after you have completed his Trial of Steel and you receive the scroll.
