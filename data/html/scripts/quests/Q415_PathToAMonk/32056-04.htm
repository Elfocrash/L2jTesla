Go and engage the Kasha Blade Spiders and Kasha Fang Spiders you find using only your Kabart training. Bring back 6 of their fangs as evidence of victory, and I will acknowledge your skills. You must fight them using only Kabart. Use no sword, spear or axe. Mark this well: if you use a weapon to obtain the fangs, I will know.
