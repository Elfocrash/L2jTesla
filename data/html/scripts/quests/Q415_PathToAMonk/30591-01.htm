Come here, young Orc. What is this fig? Is it for me? I have not been able to drink one drop of water for more than a fortnight, so this will come in handy. Thank you!<br>
I see you are a Fighter that wishes to become a Monk. So, you have come to take the Trial of Steel from me! Steel is metal that has become harder in the flame! It refers to the training process of a Monk in reaching a higher level of strength.<br>
The trial is to test your strength against fighter levels of other races that live in Gludio. Find the <font color="LEVEL">Vuku Orc Fighter on Windmill Hill in the southern part of Gludin Village, the ratman warrior on the path to the ruins, the Langk Lizardman Warrior in the Langk Lizardman Dwelling facing the southern coast, and the Felim Lizardman Warrior in the Fellmere Harvest Grounds in the northern part of Gludin Village</font> and knock them down! If you have gathered <font color="LEVEL">3 tokens from each race, adding up to 12 tokens in all</font>, put them in this purse and bring them back.<br>
Even if you fight a lower race, you could be defeated if you are absentminded. So keep your wits about you! And one thing more... you must not use any weapon during the trial, other than your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons. A true Monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
