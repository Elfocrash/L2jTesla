Mastering the fighting skills of Kabart doesn't mean you've mastered Kabart itself. Receiving into your body the energy of nature and the power of totems...these also are part of true mastery. For that, you must view and learn many things, in an effort to understand their true nature.<br>
To understand the complete oneness with everything - that is true mastery of Kabart. Those who claim to have mastered Kabart merely act out the spirits of the totems, whereas those who have truly mastered Kabart become the totem itself. Do not forget this!<br>
Now, take this lesson with you, and go to <font color="LEVEL">Seer Moira</font> in the Town of Schuttgart. If I vouch for your qualifications, she'll give you something you need.
