You? Fine! Here is the meat! This is the kind of meat that rotten <font color="LEVEL">Pasture Manager Tunatun</font> sent me!<br>
Man, the more I think about it, the angrier I get! No matter what he says, tell him that I don't care! I'm never going to do business with him again!<br>
Even if he tries to give me money, I won't accept it! Take care of it!
