<html><body>Chef Donath:<br>
I've spent a lot of time and energy on this cookbook, and I won't just give it to you for free! Bring me <font color="LEVEL">the ice crystals</font>. You can find them from a monster in <font color="LEVEL">the hot spring area</font>...<br>
You must go and find <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font>. He is working there.<br>
You must help him make soy sauce. He will show you where <font color="LEVEL">the ice crystals</font> can be found.</body></html>
