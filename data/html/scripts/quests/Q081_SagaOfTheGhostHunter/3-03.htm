Well, go to the Varka Silenos and get the Divine Stone of Wisdom. Like I said, Varka Silenos are not the ones who trust strangers easily. To obtain Varka Silenos' trust, you should go to <font color="LEVEL">Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk in the Varka Silenos Outpost</font>, and carry out difficult tasks that he asks you to do. You must earn the trust of the Ketra Orcs! This won't be an easy task, and will take much time and patience. Remember to never help their mortal enemies, the Ketra Orcs! You'd never regain their trust!</body></html>
