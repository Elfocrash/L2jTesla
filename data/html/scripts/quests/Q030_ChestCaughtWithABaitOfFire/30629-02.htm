The Fishermen's Guild is truly a major patron of the arts! Whenever an object is lost, anywhere in the world, they manage to retrieve it! It's ironic that only those who know nothing about the lost objects can find them... As an Elf, it's hard to understand how Humans could have created such a technique!<br>
Could it be that they're catching all these objects by accident? It doesn't seem likely, does it? They must be the best detectives in the world! I'm so grateful to have recovered this lost score by my dead father. I don't dare to use his name when I compose! This is his musical score!<br>
Please accept this gift of thanks for recovering the musical score for me.
