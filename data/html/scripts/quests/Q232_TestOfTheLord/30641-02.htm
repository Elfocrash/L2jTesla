<html><body>Duda-Mara Chief Takuna:<br>
Don't you know anything about the Duda-Mara tribe's totem? Our totem is the giant spider! Spinning a web and staying completely still with icy patience until the enemy falls into the trap. And once they do, we finish them off with stealth as only a predator can! This is the way our tribe fights!<br>
If you want to understand the meaning of our totem, gather the materials to make the totem! You'll need feelers and legs of spiders, but not just any spider! They must be strong and fierce spiders! I heard there are marsh spiders in the Cruma Marshlands. Collect 10 feelers and legs of those spiders and bring them to me!
