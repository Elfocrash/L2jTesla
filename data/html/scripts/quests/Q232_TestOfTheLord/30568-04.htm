<html><body>Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
Tejakar Urutu! Ten skulls of Timak Orcs, and the blade of the Urutu sword! You have brought everything that I asked for. Yes, I believe that you learned the true meaning that the skull and swords has to us when you were carrying out this test! Don't forget what you have learned! There will come a day when you shall become the leader of many soldiers and realize how important such symbols as totems are!<br>
I, Hatos of the Urutu understood well of your abilities! I feel that you are qualified enough for receiving the Mark of the Monarch! You shall have our totem. When you return with this, the Flame Lord will acknowledge you just as I did!
