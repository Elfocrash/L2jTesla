Becoming a Lord of Orcs requires a suitable test. Your test is to calm the soul of the first Orc, who died unfairly by killing the betrayer of the seven tribes!<br>
You should know, there were actually seven preceding tribes before our own. However, after the original seven went into eternal sleep, one tribe betrayed our race and all became chaos. Because of the betrayal, we have forgotten the teachings of the first Orc and wasted thousands of years fighting each other.<br>
The tribe who betrayed the seven tribes is the Ragna! You must find Ragna Orcs and punish them! That is the only way to appease the furious spirit of the first Orc.<br>
In this very moment, the Ragna Orcs have come into our tribe's land! How dare those dirty betrayers come onto the Immortal Plateau! This grievous, indignant matter cannot be left unpunished! Destroy every Ragna Orc in sight! As proof of your merciless punishment, bring one of their heads! We shall not forgive the ones who tainted our great history!
