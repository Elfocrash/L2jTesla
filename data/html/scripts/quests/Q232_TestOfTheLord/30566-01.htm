Dekara Lamchar Kakai! All praise the great Kakai, Lord of the Flame of Pa'agrio! I see by the necklace you wear that you seek the Lord's judgment! Excellent!<br>
I, Varkees, chief of the Atuba, will gladly share my knowledge with you. Tribes require symbols to rally around. Each tribe has its own unique symbol, called a totem. Once you understand the power that the totem bestows on our Atuba fighters, your skills will identify you as their lord.<br>
