<html><body>Seer Manakia:<br>
Did you come to see me, Seer Manakia, under the command of Atuba Chief Varkees? I can tell from your necklace that you are taking the Test of the Lord! Then I shall tell you what to do now!<br>
As you know in this land there are plenty of traitor Orcs, who have forgotten their origin and pride as an Orc! You must punish them severely by extracting their fangs and bringing them back to me! Our totem, the upright fang is made by collecting the fangs of the armies we've conquered!<br>
Your task is to rid the land of the Breka Orcs, and bring their fangs as proof of your victory! But don't forget, a soldier's tooth is no good! Bring only the ones of the Shaman or Overlord! Return when you have collected twenty of them!
