I, Hestui leader Kakai, will oversee your test. Take this necklace and <font color="LEVEL">visit the other 5 tribe leaders and be acknowledged as a lord</font>. As a proof of their acknowledgement, bring back <font color="LEVEL">the totem of each tribe</font>!<br>
If you bring back all 5 tribes' totems, I will personally test you to see if you are really qualified to be a lord!<br>
And take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.<br>
