Oh, this is amazing! The Totem of the Urutu tribe, an Orc's skull with a blade! Raise this horrifying form on the battlefield and your enemies will tremble and lose the will to fight! For the chief to have given you this means that he has set a high value on your skills! You should be very honored!
