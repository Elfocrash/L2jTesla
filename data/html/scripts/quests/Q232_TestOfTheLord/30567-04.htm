Young one, you have found the materials needed for making the totem of Neruga. I bet you have learned much about the spirit of the Neruga tribe!<br>
Now I, Tantus, the chief of the Neruga tribe shall give you the 'Axe of Ceremony.' It is proof that the Neruga Chief has acknowledged your abilities! If you bring this to the Flame Lord Kakai, he will also approve your abilities!
