<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br>
Have you been around to visit the Orc chiefs of the six great tribes yet? Listen carefully!<br>
The greatest of the tribes is Hestui, the tribe that I, Kakai, lead! You must seek out the chiefs of the Atuba, Neruga, Urutu, Duda-Mara, and Gandi tribes!<br>
The chiefs of the Atuba, Neruga, and Urutu tribe currently reside here, in the King's Hall!<br>
Look for the Duda-Mara Chief in the town of Oren, and the Gandi Chief at the Town of Dion!<br>
The chiefs will test you to determine if you really are worthy of becoming a lord. Pass their test and receive the totem of their tribe as an acknowledgement of your skills!
