<html><body>Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
You really don't know anything about the totem of our Urutu tribe?! The totem of our tribe is a skull with two swords! We use the head of the betrayer Orcs to make this totem! Our totem is a solemn warning for the betrayers who stained our tribe's honor! It is also a sign of strong will that we shall never stop until we have punished every single betrayer!<br>
If you wish to understand the meanings of the Urutu totem, you must bring the 2 materials needed to make it. They are the Blade of Urutu and betrayer Orc's Skull! Ask the Blacksmith Sumari about the blade!<br>
However the Skull of the Betrayer, you must find it yourself! Recently, <font color="LEVEL">in the area called Timak Outpost in the southwestern part of the Town of Oren</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Orcs of the Timak tribe</font> have been gathering. They are different from the other Orcs. They are very strong. But they are no exception to the fact that we will punish all those betrayers! You'll have to kill the Timak Orcs and gather 10 skulls from them. I suppose it will be too hard for you to do such thing all alone, so I'll let you use some help from your friends. But remember! You must chop off the betrayer's head with your own hands!<br>
Is it clear now?! What you should do?! Find the Blade of Urutu! And gather 10 Skulls of the Timak Orcs!
