<html><body>Blacksmith Sumari:<br>
I, Sumari, am a blacksmith of the proud Orcs. Did Urutu Chief Hatos send you here? To collect the Urutu Blade? The blade ordered by Hatos is very important! A holy object to use in the Urutu tribe's ritual! I had to send it to someone else to work on the blade because it was impossible for me to do. I gave it to Seer Somak so he could put the blessings of ancestors in the blade.<br>
You are in middle of the Trial of the Lord, right? It would be better for you to get the blade and give it Hatos personally. Take this letter and find Seer Somak in the Town of Dion.
