<html><body>Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
Do you truly not know anything about the Gandi tribe totem? Our tribal totem is a line that connects two circles! The two circles represent life and death and are interconnected, forming a larger circle! The warriors of the Gandi tribe, who fight to the death in order to feel more alive, know well the meaning of the circles!<br>
The line connecting the circles is represented by a monster eye and you'll understand why once you've seen a monster eye.<br>
Young Shaman, you will need the cornea of a monster eye in order to create the Gandi totem! They say that a peculiar breed of monster eye roams near the Ivory Tower of Oren. Apparently these monster eyes have been strengthened by some strange spell cast by a Mystic in the Ivory Tower. Hunt those monster eyes and bring me twenty cornea!
