<html><body>Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
The totem that you are holding in your hands is the holiest object of the Urutu tribe. It also serves as a warning for betrayers and a symbol of our resolve, stronger than death! And above all, it serves notice that I, Hatos, Chief of the Urutu tribe have acknowledged you! Do not forget the meaning of the skull with a sword stuck in it!
