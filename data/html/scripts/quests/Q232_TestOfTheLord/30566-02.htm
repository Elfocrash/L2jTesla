<html><body>Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
Ah, you didn't know about the Atuba tribe's totem? You've never heard of the Pointed Fang?! Made from the fang of an enemy Orc, it is a powerful item.<br>
Go to the southern part of our lands and there slay the lowly Orcs who have forfeited their honor and acquire their fangs! Ah, but first go to Seer Manakia in the Town of Giran and show him this amulet. He will tell you more about the Orcs you must face.
