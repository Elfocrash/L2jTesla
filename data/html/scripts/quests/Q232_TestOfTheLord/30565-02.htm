<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br>
You, warrior of our race... I shall tell you of the Overlord, the high level Shaman of our race, so listen carefully! They are those born with the fate of ruling over others! Should they become lords that lead a clan, the members of that clan shall all display remarkable power!<br>
Traditionally, we Orcs have chosen the chief of a tribe from among the Overlords. In order to become an Overlord, a Shaman must pass the severe Trial of the Lord. I endured this trial as a youngster in order to become the Overlord of the Hestui! The lord or chief that you will be serving in the future will also have passed this trial, so treat them with the reverence and honor that they deserve!<br>
(This quest may only be performed by Orc Shamans.)
