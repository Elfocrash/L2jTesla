<html><body>Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
You have brought back all of the monster eye cornea! Well done, young Shaman! I trust you understand now the significance of the line that connects the two circles. Now I, Gandi Chief Chianta, will give you a monster eye wood carving, the symbol of our tribe. This totem signifies that you have received the acknowledgement of the Gandi tribe Chief. Take this to Flame Lord Kakai!
