Excellent! I hate to throw you into the fire on your first mission, but it's vital that we find out what happened to our scout!<br>
Cool your heels a minute and I'll tell you where to focus your search.<br>
We lost contact with him inside the Swamp Of Screams. If you follow the path you can't miss it. I also marked it on your map, so don't get lost! Last thing i need is another missing person.
