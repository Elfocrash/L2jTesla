Oops, oh yeah, him...<br>
Ah! Mr. Sorint. It's nothing! Yes! Nothing unusual going here, sir! Just helping this customer.<br>
Damn that idiotic old fool... Anyway, this should be easy for you. Just bring me some <font color="LEVEL">Jade Crystals</font>. They are all the rage this year among the noblewomen of Aden! The more of them you bring me, the greater your reward shall be. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">100 or more at once</font> and I'll give you a bonus. Do we have a deal?<br>
You'll find Jade Crystals in the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font>. You may have some trouble with the <font color="LEVEL">forest runners, the fline elders, the liele elders and the valley treant elders</font>. Are you taking notes?<br>
Ah, one more thing. Enchanted Valley is too dangerous a place to walk around by yourself. So, <font color="LEVEL">bring me a few of your friends who can keep a secret. Not too many though... Once we have enough people, you can go there with them. It's too dangerous to go there alone.</font>
