This card is engraved with the Summoner's name and includes a unique mark. The tradition of the Arcana Card derives from the need for early Summoner's to exult in their victories.<br>
As an apprentice Summoner may not begin a battle until a higher level Summoner has given you a card. <font color="LEVEL">If you do not have an apprentice Arcana Card, the opponent will not accept your challenge.</font> You must give your opponent an Arcana Card each time you lose a battle. Thus, it is suggested that you make 3 or 4 extra cards for yourself.<br>
If you win, you are given your opponent's Arcana Card. It is easy to see who a Summoner has defeated by looking at his or her Arcana Card collection.<br>
