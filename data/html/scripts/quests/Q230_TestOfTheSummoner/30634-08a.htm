<html><body>Head Summoner Galatea:<br>
If you are serious about challenging a more advanced summoner, here are some likely candidates here in Aden.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Almors</font> is recuperating on <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font> at the moment. <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Basillia</font>, rumor has it, is preoccupied with studying new summoning magic at <font color="LEVEL">his seaside home in southern Gludio</font>.<br>
The Elf, <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Camoniell</font>, lives in retirement in his villa in <font color="LEVEL">southern Dion</font>; I have heard that he has had some sort of bad experience lately. <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Celestiel</font> once lived in the Ivory Tower, but apparently something happened in his hometown and he hastily returned to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Forest</font>.<br>
The Dark Elves, <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Brynthea</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Belthus</font>, seem likely adversaries for you, but you may have trouble actually finding them. The last I heard, Brynthea is in the <font color="LEVEL">eastern part of Giran</font> and Belthus is somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font>.<br>
All of these summoners are very proud, so when an apprentice summoner such as yourself challenges them to a duel, they may simply scoff at you. Eventually, however, their vanity may win out and they will accept your challenge to demonstrate their own superiority.<br>
Here, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
