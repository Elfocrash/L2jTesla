Oh my! What control!<br>
Oh well, I lost. Just as I had become sure of my victory, I let a crack open in my concentration... I must look like a fool to lose after all that bragging! Here is <font color="LEVEL">my Arcana Card</font>.<br>
Handle it with care. This has been an educational experience. This defeat was an eye-opener for me as well as for Turen. Goodbye, my friend. I will look forward to our next battle.
