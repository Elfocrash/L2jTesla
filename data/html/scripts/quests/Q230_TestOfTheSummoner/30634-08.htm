<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br>
I have several suggestions regarding opponents - there are quite a few folks who may accept your challenge if asked.<br>
First, you should try and contact <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Almors</font>. He has been sick lately and is recovering on <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font>.<br>
You should also try <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Basillia</font>. I have heard that she is busy researching a new form of Summoning magic near a farm on <font color="LEVEL">the southern shores of Gludio</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Camoniell</font>, of the Elves, has been in seclusion in a <font color="LEVEL">cottage in southern Dion</font>. I've heard he has had some trouble lately.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Celestiel</font> usually resides in the Ivory Tower, but has returned to <font color="LEVEL">the Elven Woods</font> on urgent business from her homeland.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Summoner Brynthea</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Summoner Belthus</font> of the Dark Elves may be proper opponents for you, but they are hard to find, as they are not likely to stay in one place. Last I heard, Brynthea was somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">northeastern parts of Giran</font>, and Belthus was somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Marshlands</font>...<br>
These Summoners are all proud and haughty people, and may scoff at a challenge from an apprentice Summoner like yourself. But, at the same time, they will likely accept your challenge, if only to display their supremacy over you.
