<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br>
From the very beginning, while the world was still young, from when the Elves made pacts with the original elementals of the woods, summoning magic has evolved into a high level mystical art form. Along with the ability to control the elements with spells that command fire and wind, summoning magic is one of the three traditional magical arts contained within the Ivory Tower.<br>
Learning summoning magic is not an easy path. A high level of magic is required to communicate with creatures of the netherworld, enter into a contract with them, and bring them to your aide. A very strong will is required to make the summoned creature obey your commands.<br>
Many magicians have lost their lives for lacking a strong enough will when summoning. Therefore, high level summoning spells must only be taught to those whose skills have been proven and or acknowledged. If you wish to follow the path of the Summoner, you must take the challenge and pass the <font color="LEVEL">Trials of the Summoner</font>. In my opinion, you are not yet ready to attempt the trial. Continue your training, then come and see me again.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
