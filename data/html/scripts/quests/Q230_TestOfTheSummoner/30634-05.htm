A battle amongst Summoners is fought by the summoned creatures. The lower ranked Summoner is given the advantage of the first attack. As an apprentice Summoner, you will automatically become the lowest ranked Summoner.<br>
During a battle, the Summoner may assist his or her creature with magic, but cannot physically attack an opponent's summoned creature.<br>
A penalty is given if a summoner physically attacks an opponent's creature or receives the aid of another.<br>
