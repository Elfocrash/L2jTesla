Oh, my! My poor Unicorn Phantasm! I pray he isn't badly injured!<br>
Wow, what a battle! I never imagined such a weak animal would get the better of my Phantasm! Oh, well, I suppose everyone has to lose sometimes. Take <font color="LEVEL">my Arcana Card</font>. Take heed, this is the first and the last time shall I lose to you. Take good care of my card until I can win it back!
