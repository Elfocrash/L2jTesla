<html><body>Summoner Camoniell:<br>
Whew... You are tenacious, aren't you? Ready for a fight even as the world crumbles around you? All right, I accept your challenge to a duel. This will not be easy, but at least it should be over quickly. In fact, it shouldn't take more than a minute... Let me introduce my friend, Unicorn Racer.<br>
Now, I am sure you know the rules by now. The battle is only between summoned creatures, and yours is allowed the first attack.<br>
