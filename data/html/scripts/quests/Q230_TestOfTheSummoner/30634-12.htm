<html><body>High Summoner Galatea:<br>
Fantastic! You have won 6 Arcana Cards! This is a remarkable feat and worthy of inclusion to the Summoner Archives! You are the first apprentice Summoner to bring back all 6 cards so quickly! Quite frankly, I doubted whether you would succeed... My worries were without merit!<br>
You have passed the Trials of the Summoner! Congratulations! I shall give you the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of the Summoner</font>. With your talents you will become an excellent Summoner who shall be respected and loved throughout the land. Perhaps one day you will hold one of the Major Arcana Cards...
