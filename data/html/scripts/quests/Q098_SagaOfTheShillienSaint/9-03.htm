Countless thoughts beyond comprehension once again sear painfully into your brain. Now the words of Naverius make sense. I know where the next Tablet of Vision is! It's somewhere to <font color="LEVEL">the North of Giants Cave</font>. Someone is near the tablet has the Resonance Amulet. It's hard to make out, but he seems to be riding something, and something else is bearing down on him from behind! And then the vision fades... I will go to <font color="LEVEL">the North of Giants Cave</font> where the Resonance Amulet is located.</body></html>
