You can get the next stone by killing <font color="LEVEL">the Archon of Halisha</font> in the Four Sepulchers. You'll need help to gain entry.<br>
If that proves too difficult, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Shrine of the Loyal</font> and slay Halisha's minions. If you collect 700 <font color="LEVEL">Halisha's Marks</font>, the Archon will appear.<br>
The minions include <font color="LEVEL">Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights, and Shrine Guards</font>.<br>
The next Tablet of Vision can be seen from <font color="LEVEL">the road between the Wall of Argos and Goddard</font>.</body></html>
