A long time ago, there was a beautiful forest beyond the mountains to the east of the Elven Forest. We Elves used to live there. But the land became devastated due to the forbidden magic that was used two thousand years ago during the war between the Humans and the Elves. Now it is called the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>.<br>
Today, the problem is that the Sea of Spores is slowly expanding bit by bit. Of course, we are trying to stop its expansion with a magical defense field, but our forest has become gradually contaminated over hundreds of years, from the poisons that seep out of the Sea of Spores. We are all trying our best to solve the problem, but it is not an easy thing to do. There may be a day when I will require your assistance.<br>
