Collect corpse pieces from the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Despair</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony.</font> If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis or Guard Babenco. From the <font color="LEVEL">zombies,</font> bring their <font color="LEVEL">head, heart, and liver.</font> From the <font color="LEVEL">skeletons,</font> bring the <font color="LEVEL">skull, spine, rib, arm bone, and thigh bone.</font><br>
I also need bone pieces, but actually I need a <font color="LEVEL">Complete Skeleton of Human form</font> more. Unfortunately, when you fight with the undead, their body shatters so it will be impossible to find a Complete Skeleton. But the person that took this job before you found one somehow.<br>
Ah, and don't bring back anything from the spartoi. Spartoi are his minions... It is better not to make him angry.
