You seem exhausted from dealing with the dead souls. Well, it may have been too difficult for someone like you, who has lived only in the bright world. But I keep my promises, don't I? I will compensate you for the number of items you have brought. I have put the money in this coin purse, so make sure you tuck it in your pocket.<br>
You must be swearing to yourself that you will never do such an unpleasant job again, right? I can tell just from your eyes. However, you may have to come to me in the end. You will realize in no time that there is no other job that pays as much.
