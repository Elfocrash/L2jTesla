<html><body>Guard Curtis:<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Samed</font> to get all the details. If you meet him, tell him that Curtis sent you. Then he'll know I sent you and will give you the job.<br>
I wouldn't tell anyone you are working for Samed. So I hope you won't tell anyone that you received the job from me. Do you understand what I'm saying?
