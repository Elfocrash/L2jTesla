This seems to be the <font color="LEVEL">small purple treasure box</font> that my client lost. When I opened it, I found this <font color="LEVEL">Small Glass Box</font>.<br>
It has the names of <font color="LEVEL">Anabel</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Liesel</font> engraved on it. I don't know who Liesel is, but Anabel is my client. Anabel is a Magister in Heine Castle Town. She's kept the temple there for centuries. Please deliver this glass box to her.
