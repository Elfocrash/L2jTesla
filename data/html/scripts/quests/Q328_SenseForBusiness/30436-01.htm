I know it is hard to believe, but a long time ago southern Gludio also used to be fertile farmland. However, as you can see, now it is nothing more than barren wasteland. It may seem like barren land to normal people, but true businessmen like me find opportunities in any place.<br>
I believe there are valuable commodities to be found here in the Wastelands that cannot be found elsewhere. If I am able to find them, I may begin a <font color="LEVEL">new business</font> here. When that time comes, I may need your help.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 21 and above.)
