I know it is hard to believe, but a long time ago southern Gludio also used to be fertile farmland. However, as you can see, now it is nothing more than barren wastelands. It may seem like barren land to normal people, but true businessmen like me find opportunities in any place.<br>
In the end, I was able to find something valuable in these Wastelands that could not be found elsewhere. Therefore I have decided to begin a <font color="LEVEL">new business</font> here. I would like to have a reliable partner. What do you think about working with me?<br>
