Foul betrayers, the Umbar tribe, to think that they abandoned the courage and loyalty of high-level orcs, they have become low Orcs depraved in body as well as in soul. How truly wicked they look. I am moved to think that we have shown mercy by killing them!<br>
Anyway, you have done well. You have truly demonstrated both courage and loyalty. Congratulations! I bestow this token on you. Take it and go to <font color="LEVEL">High Prefect Osborn</font> right here! He will change your profession to Orc Raider.
