<font color="LEVEL">Understanding of Miracles</font>? Ah! You are speaking of the books I sold not long ago. Threatening books? I don't know ... As for me, I don't really know the contents of the book ... I just got a few to sell because they said that a lot of people wanted to read it ...<br>
The church is collecting the books? Well, if that is the case ... I will give them to you, but I bought those books with money so the church will compensate me for them, right?<br>
I bought five books in all, and I'll give you the three that were not sold. The other two books were bought by <font color="LEVEL">Guard Praga and Priestess Vivyan in this village</font>. Go and ask them about the books.
