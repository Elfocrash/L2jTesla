<html><body>Priest Zigaunt:<br>
By any chance, have you heard the rumors that there is a heretical book that criticizes our religion? The book is called <font color="LEVEL">"Understanding of Miracles"</font>, and it was actually written by a person who used to be a priest. That is why the church wants to take care of this problem quietly.<br>
Can you retrieve the books that have been sold? Please do it undercover. The beginning of the rumor about this book was the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. Begin your search there.
