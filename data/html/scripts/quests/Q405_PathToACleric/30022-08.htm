<html><body>Priest Zigaunt:<br>
Thank you for your trouble. The church will be very happy. However, we must take care of the fundamental cause of the problem ...<br>
It is the will of the church that the writer of the book must sign a covenant saying that he will not write any more subversive content and that he will not breathe a word to anyone that he was once a priest. His name is <font color="LEVEL">Lionel</font>. He is supposedly living in retirement on <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font>.<br>
Please meet Lionel and make him sign the covenant. Well then, I thank you in advance. May the light of the heavens lead you to the righteous path.
