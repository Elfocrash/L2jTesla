Ah... that book. But that book was quite interesting. And I bought it for money. I can't give it to you for free.<br>
Well, how about this? Recently, I was making rounds in <font color="LEVEL">the Ruins of Agony</font> when I happened into a fight with the <font color="LEVEL">ruin zombies</font>. At that time, I lost a pendant that my mother left me before she died. Please find it for me. Here, this is the chain of the necklace. See if the pendant fits it, and then return them to me, please.<br>
Don't wrinkle your nose like that. A true believer like you will be protected by your strong faith. If you need direction, you can reach the Ruins of Agony by journeying west of the village.
