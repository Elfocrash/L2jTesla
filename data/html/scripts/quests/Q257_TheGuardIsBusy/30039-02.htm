<html><body>Captain Gilbert:<br>
A few weeks ago, the lord announced that he will transfer all of the refugees from the Gracian wars to Talking Island. But, as you know, Talking Island still has many regions where it is too dangerous for people to live. The southern village of the island and regions surrounding the magic school are safe, but the inland woods and northern shores are places that even we guards do not like to venture into, not only because of the vicious wild beasts, but also because of the Orc masses and violent werewolves that live there.<br>
Before going ahead with his plans to relocate the war refugees, the lord has officially issued a command to eliminate from Talking Island the dangerous beasts that pose a threat to the lives of residents. Whoever slays the orcs or werewolves, and brings back proof, will be given a reward. Already many of the young men have armed themselves and gone out from of the village.<br>
How about if you participate in the hunt? You can gain some actual battle experience, and it's also a good opportunity to receive prizes given in the name of our lord.<br>
