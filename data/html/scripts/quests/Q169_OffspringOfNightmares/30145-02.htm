My latest interest is the spirits called <font color="LEVEL">dark horrors</font>. I am currently studying these strange undead creatures. But I have yet to have a model of an actual dark horror, and my studies have not progressed significantly. At some point, I might have to ask you to get me some dark horror bones.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Dark Elven character of level 15 and above.)
