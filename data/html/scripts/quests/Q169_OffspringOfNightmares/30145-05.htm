Haven't you been able to obtain the skulls yet? Well, there's no need to rush.<br>
I repeat, to find the dark horrors, go to the swamp area that is southwest of the village. Slay the dark horrors and bring the skulls back to me. It doesn't matter if they are cracked. But you must bring me at least one Perfect Skull. If not, I cannot give you any reward.
