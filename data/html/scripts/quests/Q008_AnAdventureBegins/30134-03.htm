<html><body>Gatekeeper Jasmine:<br>
You don't have the money, skills or background to even think of visiting a foreign country through the gate of time and space! You must be an idiot!<br>
Believe me, I'm telling you this for your own good! Don't embarrass yourself and your race!<br>
You'd certainly make the same mistake that <font color="LEVEL">Sentry Roselyn</font> made such a long time ago! Adventure and romance should be left to those who can handle it! It seemed for a while that she had learned from her grievious mistake, but recently she's been showing signs of her old reckless and foolish ways. I guess some people never learn!<br>
You cannot travel through this gate. Anyway, according to the rules of our guild, no one may travel to Giran through this gate of time and space.
