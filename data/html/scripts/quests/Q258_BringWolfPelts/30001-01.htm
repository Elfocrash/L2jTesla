<html><body>Trader Lector:<br>
I am a trader now, but I used to be a leather craftsman. Even now, I buy materials every now and then to make leather clothing, gloves, cloaks, and boots. May I ask you later to find me materials if I need them?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 3 and above.)
