Hunt <font color="LEVEL">wolves</font> and bring me their pelts. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">forty of the pelts</font> and, in return, I will give you a piece of equipment that is useful to you. There is little time left if I am to finish the fifty leather armors that the governor has ordered by this week. So please hurry.
