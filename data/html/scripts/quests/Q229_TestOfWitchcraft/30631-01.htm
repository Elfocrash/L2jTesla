Ismell? He passed here a few days ago. He seemed quite pale. He was determined to go to the execution place, even though I explained to him that the undead have been exceptionally active. He refused to listen to me, saying that he can't afford to lose such a precious thing.<br>
Afterwards a terrible shriek could be heard and he has not been seen since. I suppose he has become one of those <font color="LEVEL">nameless souls</font> that wander around the Execution Grounds.
