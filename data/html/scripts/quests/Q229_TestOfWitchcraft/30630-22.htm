The <font color="LEVEL">necklace of Magister Iker</font>? Damn her eyes! I shall dispose of this right away. The Wizards of the Ivory Tower have been watching us all along with this necklace!<br>
Thank you very much, anyway. You saved us from certain disaster that was a direct result of my arrogance and greed. I am solely responsible for what happened. I was blind to the demon's tricks. Of course I can't blame the demon too much, that is just what demons do. After all, a Wizard who cannot control dark power is not much good to anyone...<br>
I wish I could take you to meet Hardin right away, but I am too ashamed to see him right now. I must meditate to recover my confidence. Take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Witchcraft</font>. From here on, the road of the Magus will appear before thee.
