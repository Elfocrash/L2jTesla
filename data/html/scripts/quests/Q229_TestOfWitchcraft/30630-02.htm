<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
The power of darkness is neither good nor bad. No one judges whether a sharp blade is good or bad... The magic depends entirely on the user. It can be used for justice as easily as it can be used for evil. There is no denying the fact that it is a very powerful tool. Learning Black Magic requires a certain degree of spiritual sophistication. I see in your eyes a lust for forbidden power... Just as no parent would give a sword to an untrained child, I will not give you the secrets of Black Magic.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 and above.)
