<html><body>Fisher Evert:<br>
When I was young, I also dreamed of traveling the world and seeking adventure. But eventually I fell in love with a woman and became a fisherman. Now I am retired, with no care but to cast my line on a peaceful afternoon... This is not a bad life at all, is it?<br>
Please remove that sword. The reflecting sunlight is scaring the fish...<br>
