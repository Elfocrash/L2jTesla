They filled their pockets with the treasures of the ancient kingdom they found on the battlefield. They sold most of them at the shop, but there arose a dispute over a few very valuable jewels. I grew weary of their bickering and confiscated 3 out of 6 jewels and sent them to Trader Nestle for safekeeping.<br>
