Why do you seek to use the Sword of Binding? The Drevanul, Zeruel? I never heard of that monster. I see from your desperate look that you are not lying. I shall give you a test. If you complete this, I will approve that your resolve and faith are strong, and give you the sanction of the church.<br>
Listen carefully. The number of pilgrims to the great shrine of Aden is growing day by day. There are also wicked Orcs who are preying upon the pilgrims. The <font color="LEVEL">Tamlin Orcs</font> of southern Aden are among them. Kill them and bring <font color="LEVEL">20 Tamlin Orc Amulets</font> as proof. This is the trial that the shrine asks of you.
