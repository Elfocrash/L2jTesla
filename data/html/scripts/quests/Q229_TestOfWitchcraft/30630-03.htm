The power of darkness is neither good nor bad. No one judges whether a sharp blade is good or bad... The magic depends entirely on the user. It can be used for justice as easily as it can be used for evil. There is no denying on the fact that it is a powerful tool. Learning Black Magic requires a certain degree of spiritual sophistication.<br>
If you are ready to learn Black magic despite the bullying and scorn of people around you, I will gladly accept you as my pupil.<br>
