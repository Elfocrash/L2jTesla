<html><body>Leopold:<br>
Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Leopold, Commander of the third platoon of the Black Lion mercenaries.<br>
Our troops are as dignified and brave as any Knights on this continent. Last summer when the drakes swarmed out of Dragon Valley, we defended Castle Giran. A few months ago when the pirates of Avella attacked the floating city of Heine, it was the Black Lions who defeated them.<br>
These days we are battling the Turek orc people of the northwestern part of Gludio at the request of farmer Piotur.<br>
