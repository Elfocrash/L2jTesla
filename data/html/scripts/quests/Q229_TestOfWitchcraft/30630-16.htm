At the last moment I was able to weaken Zeruel. It is not permanent, however. If I were to lose my concentration for even one second, Zeruel and his minions will escape.<br>
Zeruel himself holds the key to seal the box permanently. We must take the key from him and then seal him in again. To do so, we need 2 things, the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Binding</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Soul-trap Crystal</font>... Once we get these things, we will be able to bring Zeruel down and seal his spirit permanently back in the box.<br>
You should be able to get the Sword of Binding from <font color="LEVEL">Sir Klaus Vasper in Gludin</font>. I will write you a letter explaining the situation. He won't be inclined to lend his sword to a practitioner of Witchcraft... Do what you can to win his trust and borrow the sword from him.<br>
As for the Soul-trap Crystal, go and see <font color="LEVEL">Magister Iker</font> of <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font>. She is also hostile to Witchcraft, but if you explain the urgency of the situation she should let you borrow it.<br>
Meanwhile I will do my best to keep Zeruel under control. Please hurry! Although Zeruel is still weak, once he gets his strength back no one will be able to resist him!
