We must have 2 things in order to lock the devil Zeruel back into the box: the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Binding</font>, and the <font color="LEVEL">Soul-trap Crystal</font>.<br>
The Sword of Binding belongs to Sir Klaus Vasper, and the Soul-trap Crystal is owned by Magister Iker of Giran. Both of them are very prejudiced against Witchcraft and will need to be convinced to cooperate.
