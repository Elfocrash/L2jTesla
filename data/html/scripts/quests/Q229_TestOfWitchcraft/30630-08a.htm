This box is sealed with magic power and can never be opened through physical power. See these 6 grooves, one on each side of the box? Each is a lock. To open the box, each must be unlocked by inserting the right jewelry in the right order. Even the process of opening the box itself is a riddle!<br>
Look here in this bookof pictures of the jewelry required. <font color="LEVEL">Your task is to find the 6 pieces of jewelry that act as keys.</font>While you are gone, I will try to determine the order of insertion.<br>
I have heard a rumor that several pieces of jewelry cut in the imperial style were up for auction at the <font color="LEVEL">Giran Town Luxury Shop</font>. Why not travel there first and have a look?<br>
Here, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
