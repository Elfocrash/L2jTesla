<html><body>Magister Iker:<br>
The jewel bought at auction? Yes. So you noticed? That jewel is not an ordinary gem. I also felt a strong magical power emanating from the jewel, which is why I purchased it in the first place. But did you also perceive that the powers emitted from this jewel have a strong sense of... darkness.<br>
If you absolutely must have this jewel for your research, I'll trade it for something else. <font color="LEVEL">But you must first promise me that you will use the dark powers of this jewel responsibly.</font><br>
If you are like Hardin and his disciples, who were seduced by the powers of darkness and set their hands on forbidden dark magic, I shall never surrender this jewel. So promise me that you'll not use this jewel for evil purposes.<br>
