Ah! The jewels from last week's auction! They are truly exquisite, crafted with impeccable detail in the late empire fashion. They belonged to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Nestle of Gludin</font> who requested that they be put in this auction as a relic from the ancient empire.<br>
They were all sold at the last auction. I must check the account book to see who bought them...<br>
