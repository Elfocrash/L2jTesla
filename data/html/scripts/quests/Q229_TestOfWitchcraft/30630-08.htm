<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
This box seems to be impregnable. On each side is a space where a jewel should be, and the spaces all seem to form a kind of lock. The box will open only when all 6 jewels are placed in their spaces, in the right order. Opening the box will be something of a challenge.<br>
This book has pictures of the 6 jewels. <font color="LEVEL">You must find them.</font> In the meantime, I will try to find out which order they must be placed in.<br>
There is a jewelry auction at the <font color="LEVEL">Luxury Gallery of the Town of Giran</font>. You should go and check there first.
