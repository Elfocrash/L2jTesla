<html><body>Trader Alexandria:<br>
My records are very detailed. Three jewels were put up on auction.<br>
There were originally six pieces in the set, but the others were not in this set and were sold separately.<br>
The first jewel was sold to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Iker</font>. He is one of the members of the Mystics Guild of this village. The second jewel was sold to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Lara in the Town of Dion</font>. And the last jewel was sold to a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elf named Kaira</font>. She is one of the few Dark Elves who live in this village.<br>
I'm not sure, but you seem to be in something of a hurry. If need be, I will lend you my account book. You should meet the owners first, and ask Trader Nestle of Gludin about the origin of the jewels.
