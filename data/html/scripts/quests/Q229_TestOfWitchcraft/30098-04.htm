Jewels received by Mr. Nestle... I didn't realize they were so valuable!<br>
As I told you, the 3 jewels that I put on the auction were sold to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Iker, Trader Lara</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Magister Kaira</font>... You should meet them first and then ask <font color="LEVEL">Trader Nestle</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> about the source of the jewels.
