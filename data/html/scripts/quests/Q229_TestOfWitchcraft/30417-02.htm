I am entrusted with 3 swords. The first is the 'Sword of Ritual' which is used in every knighting ceremony. The second is the 'Sword of Chastity' which our ancestors received from Ordana, the lady of the forest. The last is the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Binding</font> which Artreus, the hero of Elmoreden, used to seal the magical creatures of Shilen.<br>
