I heard that Orim of the Shadows is looking for this jewel.... Are you sent by him? No doubt, it is obvious. Do you know what kind of jewel this is? What did he tempt you with? Do you think that you can learn all the secrets of Black magic just from this jewel?<br>
If you are stupid enough to believe anything that Orim says, you can have the jewel. Just remember, all knowledge has its price. The first rule of Black magic is 'You lose as much as you get'.<br>
