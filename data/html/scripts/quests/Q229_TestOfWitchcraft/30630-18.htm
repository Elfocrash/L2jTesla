Ah, the Sword of Binding and the Soul-trap Crystal! You have acquired the 2 holy objects! Now, we must find Zeruel...!<br>
My searching spell wasn't a total success, but I have a clue of where he might be. I am fairly certain that he is in the northern part of the Town of Dion, <font color="LEVEL">somewhere near the Floran Village</font>. He is probably <font color="LEVEL">dwelling inside a human body</font>.<br>
When Zeruel reveals himself, you must use all your strength to kill him. <font color="LEVEL">Remember this, the last stroke must be taken with the Sword of Binding</font> and then you must seal his spirit with the Soul-trap Crystal. I know you can do it. Please hurry.
