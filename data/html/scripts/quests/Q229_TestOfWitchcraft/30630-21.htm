I, Orim of the Shadow, declare that this prison of spirits shall bear my seal forever! It is done. Zeruel and his minions are safeley locked inside the box and the box is sealed with the magic of light. I shall keep the 6 jewels that function as the lock for safekeeping.<br>
As for the sword and crystal, I shall return them to their owners. ...I don't know why but I still get the feeling that I am being watched... <font color="LEVEL">Have you received an unexpected gift recently?</font><br>
