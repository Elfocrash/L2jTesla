<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
From time to time people like you come to me wanting to learn black magic. They're usually people disillusioned such as Knights, who have trampled innocent serfs, or Priests, who burned innocent people at the stake... They all have their reasons, but they share one thing in common... Anger at the hypocrisy of practicing cruelty in the name of justice. These people share a common desire to show that justice can also be achieved through black magic.<br>
The power of darkness itself is neither good nor bad. Just as nobody judges a sharp blade as good or bad... It depends wholly on the user. It could be used for justice as easily as for slaughter and destruction.<br>
However, if you are to arrive at justice through darkness, and grasp hold of raw dark power, you must turn your back on the light and embrace darkness, enduring the contempt and bullying of people around you. You must firmly hold true to your will, and your faith... Dear Knight, is your will strong enough?<br>
