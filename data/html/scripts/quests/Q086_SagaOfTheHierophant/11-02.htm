The Resonance Amulet that you seek is in the possession of the Archon of Halisha!<br>
 He resides inside the Four Sepulchers, but you must not pursue him there alone! Form a party with at least three other players before even attempting it!<br>
If you must pursue him alone, attack his minions at the Shrine of the Loyal. He will show himself to defend them when you've gathered 700 marks of Halisha.<br>
His minions include Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights and Shrine Guards.<br>
The Tablet of Vision that you seek can be found between the <font color="LEVEL">Wall of Argos and Goddard</font>.</body></html>
