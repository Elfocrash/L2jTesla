What is it, my child? Have you no fear of fire?<br>
...Ah, you seek the Note of Fire... I see...<br>
Of course I have it, silly! Nothing comes for free, however...<br>
If you will journey north, near the Ivory Tower, and retrieve 5 Flame Crystals from the Ghost Fires, I shall take them in exchange for the Note of Fire! But not one less than 5!
