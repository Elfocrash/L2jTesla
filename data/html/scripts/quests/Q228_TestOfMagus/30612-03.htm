You still haven't found all the seeds... What are you doing? Hurry, go and find all 3! If this mission is too much for you, then give up!<br>
If you intend to complete the task, you must go to the Fellmere Lake in Gludio, the waterfalls near the Ivory Tower of Oren, and the southern part of the Town of Giran, kill the flowers and bring back the seeds! You got it?
