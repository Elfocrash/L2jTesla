Very well. Listen to my story, youngster.<br>
Blissful slumber escapes me night after night. In the quiet darkness, I am haunted by a strange melody that reaches my ears, a music that can only be heard by those who have mastered elemental magic.<br>
Low-pitched and subtle, it nevertheless grates upon my sensitive nerves. Humans cannot make this kind of otherworldy melody, I am convinced, and it is certainly not a magician's aria.<br>
Your task is to find the source of this ominous sound. To begin your investigation, visit Parina from the temple in Gludin Town.<br>
A master of elemental magic, perhaps he knows something about this eerie nighttime melody. I must be able to sleep! Show him this letter and I am sure that he will help you.<br>
Oh, and take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
