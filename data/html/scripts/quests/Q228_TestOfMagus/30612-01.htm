I have heard of Parina's suffering because of that monstrous flower ... I have thought of nothing else for days... The only solution I can come up with is to hunt down the vicious flower and kill it.<br>
I have heard that there are actually 3 flowers: The nightmare singing flower, the phantom singing flower and the darkness singing flower. We must find all 3 of them.<br>
