To see a Mystic command the ultimate elemental magic is somewhat like hearing a song from heaven. Unlike other magic, Elemental Magic consists of combining the songs of the spirits.<br>
Your ears are not sophisticated enough to hear the elemental tones? I suppose a cacophony of swords and shields or a hymn of prayer and blessings would be easier for you to hear.<br>
(Quest for Wizards, Elven Wizards and Dark Wizards, level 39 or above.)
