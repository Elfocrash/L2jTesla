I am Undine, guardian of the deep lake, spirit of the precious water... Have you come for the Tone of Water?<br>
It is the rhythm which expresses the nature of water among the four basic elements which compose the earth... To create this, you need 20 Dazzling Drops from the monsters of the marshlands.<br>
Toad lords which live in the Cruma Marshlands... And the swamp stakatos have the Dazzling Drops. If you bring 20 of them, I shall make you the tone. This amulet is a symbol of my promise...
