The singing flowers are said to bloom near waterfalls or lakes, and seduce passersby with their beautiful voice. Different kinds of singing flowers will never bloom close to each other.<br>
Parina, Rukal and I searched for them and managed to agree on a few places. We are sure the flowers may be found near the Fellmere Lake in Gludio, the waterfalls near the Ivory Tower of Oren, and somewhere in the southern part of the Town of Giran.<br>
Got that? The flowers bloom near water. You must look in the 3 places I mentioned, especially near water. You must be very careful because the singing flowers all possess small amounts of poison... Take this amulet with you, it will help.
