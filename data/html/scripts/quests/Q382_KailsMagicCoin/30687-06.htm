Although I've only just joined, I already know all of our members by heart!<br>
Let's see, there's <font color="LEVEL">Magister Page</font> of the Magic Guild in Hunters Village, <font color="LEVEL">Researcher Lorain</font>, who can be found near the entrance of Cruma Tower, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Hagger</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Guard Stan</font> of Oren Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Duning</font> of Hunters Village, <font color="LEVEL">Trader Ralford</font> under the Ivory Tower in Oren Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Ferris</font> in Aden Castle Town, <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Collob</font> in Giran Castle Town, and... hmm, oh yes! <font color="LEVEL">Grocer Pano</font> in the plaza of Floran Village!<br>
Impressive, eh? But oh so much more impressive now that we have a royal member such as you, my lord!<br>
