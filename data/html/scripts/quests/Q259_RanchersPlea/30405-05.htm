I bought these arrows from the weapon shop when I went to the village few days ago. Trader Lector took care in selecting these, so you can use them without any worries.<br>
Personally, I would shoot arrows from a far distance to wound the spider, then approach it to deliver the final blow ... but I'm sure you have your own ways of hunting them.<br>
