<html><body>Edmond:<br>
Welcome, traveler. I originally resided in Gludio, but lost my family during the war with Gracia and moved here to start a new life.<br>
I am trying to ranch here with my old friend, Marius. We were going to take our sheep to the sunny hillside right over there and turn them out to pasture ... But the giant spiders showed up, and we lost all thirty sheep that we brought from Innadril.<br>
Soon, we're going to hire someone to kill the giant spiders around this area. Do you think you could help out with that?<br>
