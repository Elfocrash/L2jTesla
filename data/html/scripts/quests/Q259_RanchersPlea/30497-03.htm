Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">giant spiders</font> that are wrecking havoc in this area, then bring their husks back to me. I will reward you for each giant spider husk you bring back.<br>
Oh, and if you need something while hunting those spiders, ask my friend, <font color="LEVEL">Marius</font>. He takes care of everything that we bring from the village.
