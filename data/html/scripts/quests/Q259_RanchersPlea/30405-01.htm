<html><body>Marius:<br>
May the blessings of the starlight fall upon you. So you are the mercenary hired by my colleague Edmond. I was once a Knight with a sword ... But ... something happened. And I pledged not to touch a sword again. I have retired now.<br>
I felt terrible that I haven't been able help Edmond ... Thankfully, I owe you gratitude for volunteering to kill these spiders for us. Tell me anything you need. If you bring me ten giant spider husks, I will exchange them for a healing potion or arrows.
