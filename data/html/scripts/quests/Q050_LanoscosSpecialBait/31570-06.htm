You've obtained all of the Essence of Wind I need to make the bait. Please accept this as a token of my appreciation. This will increase your chances of finding lost treasure, but how often you actually land your catch will depend on your skill.<br>
Your fishing skill should be exactly level 9 to obtain the optimum performance from this bait. If you're not level 9, you might consider giving to bait to someone who is. Remember, bring anything you recover to me unopened!</body></html>
