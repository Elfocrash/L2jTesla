The power to attract items by switching their polarity is present in all four elements. Wind, ice, land and flame each have unique attractions to submerged items. Me and some of my buddies here at the guild have learned to make bait that uses these attractions to retrieve lost items.<br>
To use the power of wind, go to Windy Hill, far to the north of Gludin. You'll find some low-level wind spirits there known as singing winds. Collect <font color="LEVEL">100 essences of wind</font> and bring them to me. I'll make an special bait for you.</body></html>
