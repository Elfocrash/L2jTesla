<html><body>Fishermen's Guild Member Lanosco:<br>
Some time ago, I caught a few strange boxes while fishing. I thought it was strange to catch so many things that weren't fish! Most fishermen would've just thrown them back, but I know better! Some people will pay well for such things! They must be intrigued by not knowing what's inside... It could be something very expensive or completely worthless!<br>
I have a knack for finding these boxes, but I can't show you how to do it yet.<br>
