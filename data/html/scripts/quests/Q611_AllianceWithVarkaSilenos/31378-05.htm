<html><body>Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
Friend of Varka. You've shown great loyalty to the Varka twice before, dear friend! However, the trust of Varka will be growing as much as you've showed us. If you want to strengthen our alliance even further by becoming a 3rd level ally, bring us <font color="LEVEL">300 badges of Ketra grunts, 200 badges of Ketra officers and 100 badges of Ketra captains</font>.<br>
The badges of Ketra captains can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc captains, battalion commanders, grand seers, chief shamans, chief royal guards, prophets, Prophet's Guards, and Prophet's Aides</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if I hear that you've laid a hand on our Varka Silenos in the middle, I will not be able to trust you.</font>
