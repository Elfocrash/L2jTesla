<html><body>Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
Friend of Varka. You've done well, and the trust of Varka will be growing as much as you've showed us. But, if you truly want to take our trust to a higher level, bring us <font color="LEVEL">200 badges of Ketra grunts and 100 badges of Ketra officers</font>. Fighters like you have become essential to our victory!<br>
You can get the captain's badge by killing <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc Warriors, Lieutenants, Mediums, Elite Soldiers, Commanders, Elite Guards, White Captains, and Seers</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if I hear that you've laid a hand on our Varka Silenos in the middle, I will not be able to trust you. </font>
