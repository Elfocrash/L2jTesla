<html><body>Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
Dear and faithful friend, your countless victories for the Varka have proven your loyalty to us. However, the trust of Varka will be growing as much as you've showed us. If you wish to strengthen our alliance and become our 4th level ally, bring from the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra 300 badges of grunts, 300 badges of officers, 200 badges of captains and a Feather of Valor</font>.<br>
The feather can be obtained by undertaking the <font color="LEVEL">Prove Your Courage</font> quest, a mission assigned by Ashas Varka Durai, the elder of our tribe.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if I hear that you've laid a hand on our Varka Silenos in the middle, I will not be able to trust you.</font>
