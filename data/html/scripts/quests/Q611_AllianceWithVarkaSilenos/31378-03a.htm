You seem pretty sure of yourself, but we can't afford to take in just anybody...<br>
If you wish to fight alongside the Varka Silenos, you must drive the Ketra Orcs from their advance base! Destroy the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc footmen, raiders, scouts, shamans and war hounds</font> and bring back <font color="LEVEL">100</font> badges of Ketra grunts, then you will have proven your ability. Show us what you can do!
