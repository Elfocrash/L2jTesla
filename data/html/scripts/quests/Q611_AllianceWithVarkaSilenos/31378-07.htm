<html><body>Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
Dear and faithful friend, your countless victories for the Varka have proven your loyalty to us. There is one more mission that remains... If you wish to be our level 5 ally -- our highest honor of trust, obtain<font color="LEVEL">400 badges of Ketra grunts, 400 badges of Ketra officers, 200 badges of Ketra captains and a Feather of Wisdom</font>.<br>
The feather can be obtained by undertaking the <font color="LEVEL">Slay the Enemy Commander</font> quest, a mission assigned by Ashas Varka Durai, the elder of our tribe.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">However, if I hear that you've laid a hand on our Varka Silenos in the middle, I will not be able to trust you.</font>
