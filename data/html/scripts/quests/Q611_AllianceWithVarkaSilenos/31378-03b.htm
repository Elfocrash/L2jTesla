<html><body>Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:<br>
Are you still here? If you want to be a friend of the Varka Silenos, you must go to the advance base of the Ketra Orcs and kill them all! Kill their <font color="LEVEL">footmen, raiders, scouts, shamans and war hounds</font>. Bring back <font color="LEVEL">100 badges of Ketra grunts</font>, then you will have proven your friendship to the Varka.
