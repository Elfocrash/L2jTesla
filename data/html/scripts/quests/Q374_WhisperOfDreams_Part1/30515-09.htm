Oh my, this is unexpected... This stone has the power to transcend time, but regretfully, I can't use its magic. Only that arrogant dwarf who loiters about the entrance of Dragon Valley can release the power of this stone.<br>
Sometimes I don't understand Pa'agrio at all. How could he allow a mere dwarf such power?<br>
Well, anyway, the dwarf's name is <font color="LEVEL">Torai</font>. Take the stone to him and then come back to see me.
