To put it simply, you can't just read the text on the Tablet of Vision, you must have a <font color="LEVEL">Resonance Amulet</font>. It gives you a direct transmission of the knowledge if you <font color="LEVEL">commune with the tablet</font>. This stone is quite rare, but has been sighted recently. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Magister Justin of Goddard Castle Town</font> about what to do from here. Here, take a guild newsletter with you.</body></html>
