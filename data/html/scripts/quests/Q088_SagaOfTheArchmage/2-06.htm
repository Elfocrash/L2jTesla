<font color="LEVEL">Stones of commune and Tablets of Vision have a magical mutual attraction. You can use this force to locate the Tablets of Vision</font>.<br>
Put simply, <font color="LEVEL">when you have a Resonance Amulet, the location of the corresponding Tablet of Vision will appear in your mind. After you commune with it, the location of the next Resonance Amulet will be revealed to you. This process will become clear to you as you move along.</font><br>
Now take the first Resonance Amulet I gave you and find the <font color="LEVEL">Tablet of Vision south of the Tower of Insolence</font>!</body></html>
