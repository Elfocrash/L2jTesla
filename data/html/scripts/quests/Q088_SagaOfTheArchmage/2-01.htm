<html><body>Magister Justin:<br>
Grand Magister Valleria didn't know that I'm conducting an investigation under the guise of Justin. In a letter I intercepted Valleria wanted Justin to discourage you from becoming an Archmage! Don't worry, since I'm not bound to him I can still tell you what you need to do to become one.<br>
