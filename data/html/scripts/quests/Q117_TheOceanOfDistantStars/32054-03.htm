<html><body>Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:<br>
It is as you see... We are all dead and cannot hold a hammer. When we realized we could no longer work, we started to go insane, and this is the result.<br>
The ghost you spoke with was a good man once, and strong, so he may outlast many of us. Still, it's just a matter of time, as it was with me.<br>
May I ask a favor of you? This is just between us...
