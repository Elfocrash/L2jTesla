<html><body>Seer Manakia:<br>
Ever since the kingdom of Orcs first fell, Giran, has been ruled by the Humans. But Humans are weak, so the outsiders we once beat have started attacking again! What a mess!<br>
Take this totem to begin with which has our ancestors' spirits within it and it will guide you on your way! In eastern Giran, live medusas who are kin to serpents. Slay them and obtain the remains of Hermodt from them! The medusas split the bones into five pieces and distributed them among several of their kind.<br>
The important remains are held by the Gorgon Queen, Stenoa! There is no doubt that she is the descendent of the Queen that Hermodt killed! I, Seer Manakia, order you to go and kill the Queen of medusas, to revenge the death of Hermodt, and take back his skull! After you've killed the Queen, go after the other medusas as well to recover his rib-bones, backbone, arm bones, and shinbones too!
