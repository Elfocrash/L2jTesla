Tejakar Oroka! You have found the remains of all 4 heroes! I shall place these bones in the blessed pot. Meanwhile, you prepare for the next stage of the trial.<br>
To win over the power hidden in the remains of heroes, you must go through the War Spirit's Trial. To carry out this holy and solemn trial, you must see the forefather spirit Martankus in the Cave of Trials. But before seeing him, you should prepare an appropriate present for him.<br>
I think he will be most pleased to receive the heads of the betrayers, so go to the south of Aden and kill the Tamlin Orcs there. Bring back their heads as the present to give to Martankus! You must bring at least 13 heads!
