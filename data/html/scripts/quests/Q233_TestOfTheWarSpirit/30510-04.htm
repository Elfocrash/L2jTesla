A Warcryer is a supreme level Mystic who deals with the war spirits! Their fierce roar makes our soldiers burn with combativeness and dooms the enemies! Their hymn inspires our troop's morale and freezes the heart of our enemies!<br>
Thou, Shaman of Orc! If you truly wish to be Warcryer, you can't avoid the War Spirit's Trial! The war spirits are the ghosts of our ancestors who died in the battlefields! You must be able to win their power over to your side! That is what the trial is all about! Will you challenge the trial?<br>
