Braki of the Duda-Mara tribe, fought against the 3000 army troops of Elmore with only 200 soldiers, some 500 years ago. He didn't yield the camp site of Horsehoof Valley and resisted for 100 days! Braki took advantage of the steep landscape and overcame the inferiority in numbers! Moreover, there were only 3 Sorcerers in the camp but he made the most out of them and managed to weaken the leader and cause disruption among the enemies.<br>
But the very day the back-up troops arrived, Braki died of hunger, thirst, and fever! It is said that he grieved bitterly about the fact that he couldn't die in the battlefields! He was an Orc who was not only clever in the head, but also burning with combativeness in his heart!<br>
According to my research, Braki's Remains are in the hands of a Human evil magician called Orim the Shadow. How dare a filthy and wicked magician touch the remains of our honored ancestor! I shall not tolerate that! Hurry and win back the remains of Braki from him!<br>
