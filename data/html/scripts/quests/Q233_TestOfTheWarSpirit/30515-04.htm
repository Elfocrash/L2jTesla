That was magnificent, young shaman! You have driven out the medusas and taken back the remains of our fallen hero!<br>
It is sad to see this Warrior's remains in such poor condition. I cannot feel his spirit while his remains are like this! I, Seer Manakia shall readjust <font color="LEVEL">Hermodt's Remains</font>, to a more discernible shape!<br>
Oh, young Orc, even after you pass the Test and move on to a higher level, you must never forget the spirits of our great heroes! The glory of our forefathers who fought for the tribe!
