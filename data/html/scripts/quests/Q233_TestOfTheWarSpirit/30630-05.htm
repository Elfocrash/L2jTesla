<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
Like it is said in the document, I will give you Braki's Remains if you find me the materials that I asked for.<br>
I will repeat one more time, just to make sure. The things that I need are porta eyes, excuro scales, and mordeo talons. Ten of each is what I need. You can find them all in the Cruma Tower.
