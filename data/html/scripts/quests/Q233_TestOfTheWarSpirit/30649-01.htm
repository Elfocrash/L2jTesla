<html><body>Ancestor Martankus:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! I am Hestui Martankus, Lord of the Grizzly Tribe who died during the war between Men on the Immortal Plateau a thousand years ago!<br>
My descendent, heed your ancestor!<br>
I have experienced a thousand years of pain watching the collapse of the kingdom and the disintegration of my race! The unending, unbearable sorrow of seeing my descendents lose the memory of their glorious past.<br>
My offspring, present me with a gift that matches my dignity and power!<br>
