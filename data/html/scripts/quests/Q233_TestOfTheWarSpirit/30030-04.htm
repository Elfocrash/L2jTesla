According to the records, the graves of Kelhas and Kiruna are in the south of Gludio, a place which has now turned into a Wasteland area. But that was already a thousand years ago... I am not sure if their remains will still be there...<br>
Perhaps Sarien who knows the area well, might know of its whereabouts! I shall write you a letter. You'd better go and meet him. He is doing commerce near the southern entrance of the Wasteland.
