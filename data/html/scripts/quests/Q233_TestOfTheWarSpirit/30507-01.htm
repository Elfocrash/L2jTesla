Young shaman, do you seek the remains of the legendary Warrior Kiruna? First you must listen to her story!<br>
In a time long ago the supreme commander of our army asked for our support in a tough battle with the devil Beleth. Kiruna led a crack contingent off to the battlefield. Kiruna and her soldiers fought bravely against numerous undead and the front line did not waver.<br>
That is, until the dreaded Death Knight Mordreous appeared on the battlefield. The soldiers, overwhelmed by fear and Beleth's magic, began to retreat...<br>
However, Kiruna was fearless. She took the battlefield alone, singing hymns of victory and slaughtering hundreds of undead, and finally the death Knight Mordreous!<br>
