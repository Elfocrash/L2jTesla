To pass the test, you should first <font color="LEVEL">find the ashes of the ancestors who lost their lives warring for this land!</font> With their ashes, you can use a ritual to harness the power of their spirits.<br>
Perhaps even more important, we can finally lay their remains to rest in the Immortal Plateau. What more fitting tribute can there be to our ancestors, whose victories once sounded from one end of this land to the other. Ah, but that was before Aden Kingdom, before the Humans began their rule. Now even our own Orc children forget our noble heritage!<br>
I, Seer Somak, have long studied our tribe's chronicle, handed down from generation to generation, and have learned the identity of the 4 warriors whose ashes you must recover: <font color="LEVEL">Braki the Clever, Kiruna the Brave, Tonar the Super and Hermodt the Indomitable!</font>When you have found all of these great warriors' ashes, return here.<br>
Before you go, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it for something special from the village gatekeeper to assist you on your journey.<br>
