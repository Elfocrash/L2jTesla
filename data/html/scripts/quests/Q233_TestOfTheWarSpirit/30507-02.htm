After the death of beleth, Kiruna remained in the Human's world and became the Commanding General of the kingdom's west army. Some human poets said that Kiruna fell in love with Kelhas, the Einhasad Paladin, but that's absolute nonsense! Why would an Orc Amazon fall in love with a weak Human!<br>
Kiruna died after suffering from a mysterious fever. The Humans buried her with the other Human Warriors in the cemetery. It is obvious that a great hero like her should have a grand funeral in the Cave of Trials! However Kiruna herself asked to be buried with the other Human soldiers.<br>
I don't know where that place is exactly. But I found out that there are records left about Kiruna in the Einhasad temple of this village. Go to the temple and find out about Kiruna's Remains! I also heard that a female Human called Vivyan knows something about it. I shall give you this totem. It is a precious thing which contains our ancestor's spirits. I think it will help you in finding the heroine's remains. Now it is time for you to leave. Meet Priestess Vivyan of the village temple.
