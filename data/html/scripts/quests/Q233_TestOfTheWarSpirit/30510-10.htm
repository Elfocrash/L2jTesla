To carry out the ceremony of the war spirits, you need to see the forefather spirit of Martankus. Now take the heroes' remains to the eternal Holy Land for Orcs, the Immortal Plateau. And meet the forefather spirit Martankus which dwells in the Cave of Trials.<br>
Remember to show your utmost respect to the great ancestors. Politely offer your gift and tell him that you wish to go through the War Spirit's Trial. Tejakar Pa'agrio! May the powers of fire be with you!
