I bet that the grave of the Orc Warrior that you are looking for was already excavated and destroyed. But they say that once in a while, the ancient relics are found in the ant tunnel so if you are lucky enough you might find the bones that you are looking for.<br>
If my guesses aren't wrong, it must be the soldier ants who carry such things as bones and remains. I think they'll have cut it into 5 pieces more or less. Good luck, then!
