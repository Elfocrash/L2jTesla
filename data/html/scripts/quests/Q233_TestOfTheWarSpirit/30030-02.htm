Ah! Commander Kiruna, the only Commander in the whole Orc Kingdom. She fell in love with Paladin Kelhas... The love story of Kelhas and Kiruna is written in the history of the shrine, and I found it so touching that I read it several times.<br>
Oh, don't give me that look! I know you Orcs don't like to hear about an Orc that fell in love with a Human being. So sorry... but their story... it is so romantic...<br>
