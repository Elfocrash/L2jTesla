<html><body>Priestess Vivyan:<br>
Kiruna and Kelhas were Warriors who fought bravely against the army of the devil Beleth. They won every battle, but one day Kelhas was killed by the evil spirits of Beleth. Imagine Kiruna's sorrow when the news reached her that her lover had been killed. A few days after Kelhas's death, she took to the battlefield with grim determination and won a great victory over the army of Beleth.<br>
But unfortunately she received a mortal wound in the final battle. She was taken to the shrine for treatment, but soon died and was buried beside Kelhas. Some say that she refused treatment...<br>
Sometimes the feelings which appear to be weak-mindedness can be the source of great power. Do you see?<br>
