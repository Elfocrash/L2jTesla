The Lizardman shamans understood the power hidden in Tornar's body. So they ran off with the remains. Then afterwards, with the bones, they made several fetishes. Those fetishes are still handed down among the Leto Lizardmen until this day!<br>
The Leto Lizardmen formed a strong force in the southern part of Oren. I suppose the Leto chiefs or shamans who lead the group, have the amulet made from Tonar's Remains. Go ahead and take back the remains of our hero! Those bloody lizardmen, dared to split the bones into a skull, rib bones, backbone, arm bones and shin bones. There are 5 pieces altogether! Take this with you! Our forefathers' spirits dwelling in this totem will guide you on your way!
