A Warcryer is a supreme level Mystic who deals with the war spirits! Their fierce roar makes our soldiers burn with combativeness and dooms the enemies! Their hymn inspires our troop's morale and freezes the heart of our enemies!<br>
Thou, great Warrior of the Orcs! Do not forget that the Mystic is one of the most appreciated strengths on the battlefield! Thou shall bow the knees to their bright wisdom and unyielding spirits!<br>
