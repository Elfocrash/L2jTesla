<html><body>Orim of the Shadow:<br>
First, I need the eye of a creature called a porta. They call it the eye but in fact it is a small and solid thing like a jewel. And scales of an excuro. Those scales of the excuro are as hard as Steel but once you kill it, it is easy to peel them off. And finally, I need a mordeo talon. It is a silver-white, hook shaped claw. I want you to find ten of each item. All the creatures that I mentioned can be found in the Cruma Tower of northern Dion.<br>
I have written down our Contract in this document. I know that it may seem absurd to you, but it is meant to prevent any shameful events that may take place later on. Take it, just in case. I will be waiting for your safe return.
