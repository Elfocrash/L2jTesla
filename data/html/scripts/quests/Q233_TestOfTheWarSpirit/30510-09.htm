Well done! Death to the filthy betrayers! That is what they asked for! Their decapitated heads will be the best gift for our ancestor spirits.<br>
Now take the hero's remains to the eternal Holy Land for Orcs, the Immortal Plateau. And meet the forefather spirit Martankus which dwells in the Cave of Trials. To carry out the War Spirit's Trial we need his help for sure.<br>
If you carry this totem with you, he'll know that you came for the ceremony. Be careful to show your respect to the great ancestors. Politely offer your gift and tell him that you wish to go through the War Spirit's Trial. Tejakar Pa'agrio! May the powers of fire be with you!
