I'm going crazy here! So many things to do... And nothing seems to be going right... What is the guild thinking, giving me such an assignment? What could they possibly expect me to do? Sometimes I wonder why I stay in this stupid guild!<br>
How long have you been standing there? I was just talking to myself. You're an adventurer, am I right? I don't have any work to give you right now. Come back later.<br>
