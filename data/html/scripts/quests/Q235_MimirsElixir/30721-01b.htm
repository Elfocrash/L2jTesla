<html><body>Magister Ladd:<br>
Long ago, I studied potions. The magic of the giants, secrets of the gods... That was the stuff of my research.<br>
But such knowledge is not for mere mortals such as us... I sealed that research and put it out of my mind for a long time.<br>
However, recently, I've been thinking... If some hero was to come along that didn't fear the wrath of the gods... If I happened to meet such a hero, I think I might just be willing to restart my research!<br>
