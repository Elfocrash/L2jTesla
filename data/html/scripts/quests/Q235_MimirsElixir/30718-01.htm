What's the world coming to? Magister Ladd, asking for help?<br>
He wants True Gold, eh? I'll wager he's restarted his research into Mimir's Elixir! He swore he'd given it up!<br>
He gave all of his True Gold to me, and said he wouldn't need it again! And now you've come, asking for it back! I suppose he thought I would just keep it for him? Ha! I used it up long ago!<br>
If he really needs it, I can make more. But it won't be easy...<br>
