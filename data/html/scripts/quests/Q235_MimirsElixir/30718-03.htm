Very good! You shall leave immediately for the <font color="LEVEL">Silent Valley</font>!<br>
I want you to deal with the <font color="LEVEL">chimera piece</font>. You'll find many other creatures there, but they're all shadows of the same being. Though only one holds the Sage's Stone, there's really no way of telling which one it is. Just keep killing chimera pieces until you find it. Thank you. Now get going!
