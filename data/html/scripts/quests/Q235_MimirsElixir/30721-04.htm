Now that I think back on it... I must have been the fear... I am a devoted Elf, seeking enlightenment from the goddess Shilen. My search inadvertently brought me into direct conflict with the gods!<br>
I'm no hero, but it became a driving force in my life to discover the source and true nature of magic. I wanted no more. I could have chosen the path of destruction, following the likes of Baium and Beleth, but did not.<br>
There are but two types of heroes, and given the choice, I chose enlightenment.<br>
