.... Can you feel it? I'm curious.... Tell me, what do you feel?<br>
Maybe it hasn't taken effect yet... But trust me, you'll never be the same... You must go to a grand master, Grand Magister, warehouse chief or prefect and ask about a <font color="LEVEL">class transfer</font>. Thus you can escape your fate that was planned by the gods and pursue your own dreams.<br>
To commemorate this day when you took your destiny into your own hands, please accept this small gift.<br>
It is time for us to part. I'll be watching your progress. Will you save the world from the coming chaos or will you hasten its destruction? That is now up to you.
