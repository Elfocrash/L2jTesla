<html><body>Magister Ladd:<br>
Not long ago, a stranger visited me asking about the research that I performed long ago. He seemed very familiar to me... Who was that?...<br>
He got me thinking about things I haven't thought about in years... I remember thinking how the research was really dangerous, and I stopped doing it because I feared the effect it could have on our true essence...<br>
But the stranger said...<br>
"Soon, a traveler carrying a Star of Destiny will come to see you.<br1>
It is he who shall take control in the future era of chaos. He must learn how to escape the shackles of fate forced on him by the gods.<br1>
Ladd, you must tell him how..."<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character possessing a Star of Destiny.)
