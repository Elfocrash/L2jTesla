Wonderful! You have brought some extremely Pure Silver... Such a simple, yet magical substance.<br>
You're obviously committed to your mission. All of these things coming together can't be a coincidence... The Star of Destiny, Mimir's Elixir... And those two strangers asking around about me...<br>
There can be only one explanation: My role in life is to make Mimir's Elixir for you... All of my work up to now has been preparing me just for this mission.<br>
