... Mimir's Elixir can teach you things that you would otherwise never learn in this dimension. This can be a very dangerous knowledge, and some even say that it goes against the will of the gods.<br>
At the time of the creation, the gods bestowed physical skills and magic upon the races in differing ratios. Dwarves have weaker magical skills but have outstanding dexterity and intelligence. Orcs have amazing strength and battle skills, but no connection with servitors. There are similar trade-offs among all the races. It's the first law of nature and the will of the gods that we all have limits. The natural order is violated if we carelessly exceed them.<br>
Your new strength may cost you more than you realize. Consider your options carefully.<br>
I've said enough already. Ladd is waiting... Run along... Don't forget what I've said...
