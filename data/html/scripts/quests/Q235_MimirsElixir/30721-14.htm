You've done it! This is the legendary elixir discovered by the giant, Mimir. How to use it? Simple enough... Drink up! Honestly, I just wanted you to do it here so I could see what happens to you...<br>
Before you drink, I should tell you... While you were at Lair of Antharas, the man in black armor came back. He asked me to give you this letter. It seems to be written in the language of the ancient Ferios empire. Who could read something like this? I can only think of a few... But hey, what do you know? One of them is me!<br>
