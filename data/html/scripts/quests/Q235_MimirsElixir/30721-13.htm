Obtain Blood Fire by killing bloody guardians in the Lair of Antharas.<br>
Once you get the Blood Fire, create Mimir's Elixir using the mixing urn under the Ivory Tower. Combine Pure Silver and True Gold, using Blood Fire as a catalyst. Set the temperature to #3 Phoenix...<br>
Once you've made the elixir, bring it to me. I'll show you how to use it.
