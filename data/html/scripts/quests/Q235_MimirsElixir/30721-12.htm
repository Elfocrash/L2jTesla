Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Lair of Antharas</font> and kill the <font color="LEVEL">bloody guardians</font>. For your efforts you will get Blood Fire, the flame of purgatory that burns in their bodies. This is what we will need to mix True Gold and Pure Silver.<br>
Use this mixing stone in conjunction with the <font color="LEVEL">mixing urn under the Ivory Tower</font> to combine the three ingredients. Set the temperature to #3 Phoenix.<br>
Mimir's Elixir will be born from that flame.
