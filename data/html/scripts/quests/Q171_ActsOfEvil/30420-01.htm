Hmm, I ordered the mold over a month ago... This merchandise is a week late and it looks like it's been damaged.<br>
Regardless of whether the cargo was stolen or not, you're responsible for delivering the goods on time. However, it is true that Turek orcs are carrying out raids of unprecedented audacity. I will make an exception this time. This time I will pay you, as specified in the Contract. From now on, please make sure that my orders arrive on time. Give this bill to Trader Arodin.
