So sad. Those heroic patrolmen gave their lives for this information...<br>
Let's see... What's this? Ol Mahums allied with Dwarves...?! What treachery!<br>
This is treason! We must tread carefully, my friend. The influence of the Dwarven Guild cannot be ignored. If we rushed in and made such charges that were later proven untrue, we would be in serious trouble.<br>
We need proof of this conspiracy of Dwarves and ol mahums! Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> and check out the <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum generals</font>. That should yield some proof.
