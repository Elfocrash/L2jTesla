<html><body>Guard Alvah:<br>
A Contract? What's this? Hmmm, a Contract to purchase a large supplies of weapons. Look at this seal at the bottom! The mark of a Dwarven Guild! Could this be the proof we need that Dwarves are providing ol mahums with weapons?<br>
We must find out which guild uses this seal, but we can't ask the Dwarves directly...<br>
Have you met <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font>, who lives in this village? Ask her! She used to live among the Dwarves in Schuttgart and knows their ways.
