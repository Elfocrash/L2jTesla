<html><body>Guard Alvah:<br>
The patrols that we sent to spy on the Ol Mahums must have gotten some valuable information about them. The last message we got from them said that they were hiding from the ol mahums in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>. I fear that they may have been killed by the <font color="LEVEL">Tumran bugbears</font> that frequent that desolate place...<br>
Please hurry and find out what happened to the patrols!
