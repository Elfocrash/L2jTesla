Kaaah aak!!! Listen to me, brave Turek Warriors! Gludin Is no longer our target! We must annihilate our true enemy! Tomorrow morning we shall attack the barracks of the Ol Mahums!<br>
You're a mercenary, right? Then I want to hire you to go and cut off the heads of the <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum captains</font>! Bring me back at least <font color="LEVEL">30 of their heads</font>! Then I will give you a wonderful prize!
