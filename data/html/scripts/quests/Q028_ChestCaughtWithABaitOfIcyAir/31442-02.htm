The letter!<br>
I had given up on it. The guild sent it a while back, but the ship ran aground and all was feared lost.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Don't let anyone else know about this! If word got out that Dwarves had lost it, it could damage our reputation as the most reliable race! Here is a gift for your trouble. As a Dwarf, I must show my gratitude for your kindness.
