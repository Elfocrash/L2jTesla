This seems to be the <font color="LEVEL">large yellow treasure box</font> that my client lost! When I opened it, it contained a letter addressed to Miss Kiki.<br>
The Dwarves must've really hated to lose this one! They're always bragging that they've never lost an item! Take this chest to Mineral Trader Kiki.
