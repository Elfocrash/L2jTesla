Very well! You must prepare to impress the committee... There is an excellent opportunity available, I've heard a strange rumor...<br>
It's said that <font color="LEVEL">Kail's Coins were discovered in the Forsaken Plains</font>. At one time Kail was Beleth's right-hand man. Bring me some of these coins. Also, if you buy a <font color="LEVEL">"Coin Collecting Album" from Trader Sandra of Giran that she sells only when she is in a good mood</font>. Then, you will surely be chosen by the committee!
