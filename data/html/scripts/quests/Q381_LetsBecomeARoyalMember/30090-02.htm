I'm a coin collector, too. A while back, another coin collector told me that the rare coins of Elmore were also quite valuable, although the war has left most trade routes to Elmore impassable. But this didn't slow me down! A delivery of very valuable coins has been stolen by <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Chieftain Vegus</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Forsaken Plains</font>! It included the <font color="LEVEL">rare golden clover coin</font> I was looking for! These coins are still contraband, so I can't go after them myself. Bring me at least one of the <font color="LEVEL">rare golden clover coins</font> and I'll make a high-quality coin collection book for you. Vegus usually appears in the Forsaken Plains two to three times a day. Find him there.
