<html><body>Fishermen's Guild Member Willie:<br>
Hi, traveler! Have you ever been fishing? You'll find it much more relaxing than the life of a soldier! Why don't you come back and let me teach you to fish when you have the time. It won't be free, but your fishing skill should be exactly level 16.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 48 and above.)
