Thank you. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Underground Fortress</font> and find the remaining four scrolls. I have discovered his second poem already. What you must find are the scrolls containing his first, third, fourth and fifth poems. I think that the foolish <font color="LEVEL">baraq orcs</font> that live in the ruins may have mistaken Rumiel's scrolls for magic scrolls and hidden them.<br>
I implore you! I am certain that the cultural wealth of our race will become richer with the recovery of Rumiel's poems.
