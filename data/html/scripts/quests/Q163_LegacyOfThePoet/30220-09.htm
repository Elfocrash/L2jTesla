<html><body>Sentinel Starden:<br>
So you have recovered all of Rumiel's poems. Now I can read my friend's poetry once again.<br>
I plan to put these together with the other poems that Rumiel wrote and publish a poetry book. Now my Elven brothers may also enjoy Rumiel's fine poetry. This is the only thing I can do for Rumiel, whom I could not save in battle.<br>
Please accept this. This is for your work in recovering the scrolls. May the blessings of the starlight fall upon you.
