<html><body>Sentinel Starden:<br>
Unfortunately all of those five poems were lost. We were defeated in the siege of the Underground Fortress, and three Sentinels, including myself, barely managed to escape with our lives. But Rumiel was killed in that battle. The sheepskin scrolls where his poems were written were lost, along with him.<br>
Some time ago I went to the abandoned dungeons to recover my friend's work. But I only managed to find one of Rumiel's five scrolls. I want to go to the dungeons again to look for the rest of the scrolls, but I cannot leave my post due to the recent battles with the Orcs of the Misty Mountains. I desperately want to recover my friend's legacy, and am frustrated because I cannot.<br>
Do you think you could go to the Underground Fortress and find the <font color="LEVEL">scrolls where Rumiel wrote his poems</font>?<br>
