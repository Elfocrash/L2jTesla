<html><body>Sentinel Starden:<br>
According to legend, the Eldarin of the beginning of the world -- or the 'Gods,' as the Humans call them, created various races and gave each race different knowledge. The Orcs received the art of war from Pa'agrio, the Dwarves trade and craftsmanship from Maphr, and we received poetry and songs from Eva. The other races hold our Elven magic and archery in high regard, but I think that the greatest achievement of the brothers of the forest is the culture and music that we have developed over thousands of years.<br>
I have been trained as a Sentinel, protector of the forest, but I spend my spare time composing and writing poetry. Though my poems are not good enough to recite to others. But it was a different case for my old time friend and colleague, <font color="LEVEL">Rumiel Moonshine</font>. He was a warrior with the heart of a poet. The short poems that he recorded in the life and death situations of the battlefield were a great comfort to our sentinel brothers who were weary of fighting. His voice, which sang of the beauty of the forest, the wind and the springs, made us remember what we were fighting for.<br>
