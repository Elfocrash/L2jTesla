<html><body>Sentinel Rayen:<br>
Stranger with an unfamiliar gaze, please be careful if you should venture outside the village. The woods are full of danger, as there is a war going on between our race of the woods and the kaboo orcs of the Fog Mountains. But do not worry, the Elven warriors will soon drive the orcs out of our woods.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven character.)
