<html><body>Sentinel Rayen:<br>
The orcs of Fog Mountains are becoming bolder and bolder lately. Before, they wouldn't dare set foot into the Elven Forest, and now they dare to come into the village.<br>
Pretty soon, we plan to recruit brave brothers to help us defeat these fearless invaders. I hope you will take part in this when the time comes.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 6 and above.)
