<html><body>Sentinel Rayen:<br>
Now go into the Elven Forest and fight the kaboo orcs. But you must keep this in mind. A hierarchy exists within the orcs, and because fighter or leader levels are stronger than lesser orcs, you may be in trouble if you do not take care.<br>
The lesser orcs carry <font color="LEVEL">feather amulets</font>, while the high level orcs wear <font color="LEVEL">necklaces made from bones</font>. Gather these items as proof and bring them to me.<br>
May the goddess guide your blade and arrows! Teach those orcs a stern lesson that they should never even think of setting foot into the Elven Forest!
