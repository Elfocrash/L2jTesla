My son Bright stands guard at the front gate. He's not allowed to leave his post for personal reasons while he's on duty. When the weather is bad like this, my knees hurt so badly I can't walk!<br>
Occasionally my son has to leave his post to chase a criminal. Would you go and find him? Get a Fruit Basket from him and bring it to me. I can't walk a step!
