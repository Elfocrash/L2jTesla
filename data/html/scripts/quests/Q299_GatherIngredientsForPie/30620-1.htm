The highest quality honey can be found in the Beehive, but the insects that guard it are actually wasps! These wasps store honey in a organ called a honey sac inside their body. This is by far the finest honey, but it's extremely scarce! To make a pie I'll need at least 100 honey sacs! Get them by killing <font color="LEVEL">Wasp Leaders</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Wasp Workers</font>.<br>
Get <font color="LEVEL">100 honey sacs</font> and bring them to me.
