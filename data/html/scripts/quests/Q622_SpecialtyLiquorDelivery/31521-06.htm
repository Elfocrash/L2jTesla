This liquor was made by my great-great grandmother for the soldiers at war. They say that the soldiers who drank it were swept up in ecstatic fervor, and were victorious in war! I don't know if that's true or not...<br>
Anyway, I realize that you must be rewarded, but I don't have any adena at this moment. Would you mind speaking with Warehouse Keeper Lietta in the Town of Goddard? She has quite a bit of my adena. Tell her I sent you and she'll take care of you.
