<html><body>Blacksmith Brunon:<br>
Have you recovered all my jewels? Not yet? Have you forgotten about our contract? I promised that if you restore all my jewels that the <font color="LEVEL">Goblin Brigand Lieutenant</font> took from me, I would give you the diamond back that I won from your friend, Torocco. You have to find my <font color="LEVEL">ten Aquamarines</font> and <font color="LEVEL">ten Chrysoberyls</font>.
