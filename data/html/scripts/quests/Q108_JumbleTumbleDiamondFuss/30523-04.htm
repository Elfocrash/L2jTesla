Have you met Reep? Not yet? What in the world are you doing? If you've made up your mind to do this job, you'd better be responsible and get to it! Go and meet <font color="LEVEL">Trader Reep</font> at the weapon shop and ask him where my diamond is, right now. If you show him this Contract, he can't pretend that he doesn't know anything!
