What? Isn't that Murdoc's lucky Coal Piece? Why do you have it?<br>
Oh my! I gave you the wrong Gem Box! How on earth...? Look, I didn't mean to deceive you. This sounds terrible, but I thought the Gem Box that <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Murdoc</font> entrusted to me was the Gem Box with the diamond in it. Ha ha ha... I didn't mean this to happen, so please forgive me.<br>
I'm very sorry. I will write a letter explaining this situation, so take this to Warehouse Keeper Murdoc. Then you will be able to get your Gem Box back.
