Why have you come back? Didn't I tell you? I don't have the Star Diamond!!! The last person who had the jewel was <font color="LEVEL">Carrier Torocco</font>. If you find him, show him the Contract I gave you and ask him why the delivery is taking so long. I have nothing to do with this anymore, so don't come back to me again.
