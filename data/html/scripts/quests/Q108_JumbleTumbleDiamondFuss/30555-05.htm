... What should I do ... What should I do ... How can I ever get the diamond back ... I am in so much trouble ... Gouph will kill me ... What should I do ... What should I do ... Disqualification and excommunication from the guild ... ... Expensive fines that I can never pay back in this lifetime ... The mocking laughter of my colleagues and my family ... Aghh ... This is the end of my life ...
