Good! Do you know <font color="LEVEL">Trader Reep of the weapons shop</font>? He got the Star Diamond for me as my agent in Giran. That fellow is a master of bargaining, and so he got me a really nice price for the jewel. Go see him and ask him what's going on. If you show him this Contract, that scoundrel can't play innocent!<br>
And tell him this ... if that no-good crook is planning to cheat me, I will not let him get away with it!
