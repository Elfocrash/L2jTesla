Hey, young friend! Have you ever heard of the jewel called the Star Diamond? It's a very rare gem of which only twelve exist on the entire continent. Due to a recent stroke of luck, I've managed to obtain one of those Star Diamonds ... It will be delivered here in few days ... I am so excited ...! Hoo Hoo Hoo ...<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 10 and above.)
