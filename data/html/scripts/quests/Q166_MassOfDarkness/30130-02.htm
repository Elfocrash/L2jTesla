<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Soon we will hold the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> in honor of Gran Kain of the darkness and Shilen, the mother of the abyss. This mass is the most sacred religious ceremony of our race. The Human Mystics of the Ivory Tower who attended last year's mass were awed at the size and magnificence of the mass. This year's mass will be no less grand. The clergy of the temple are very busy with preparations. There are a few items needed for the mass that must be fetched from the village. If we are short on help later, I may need you to deliver those items for me.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Dark Elven character of level 2 and above.)
