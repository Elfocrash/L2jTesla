So Undrias has sent you. Please give this scripture to him. It was discovered in an abandoned mine by sentry warriors sent to the Misty Mountains to fight the orcs. Surprisingly, it is a scripture written by ancient Humans who served Gran Kain. Isn't that interesting?<br>
Undrias says that he plans to recite a portion of this scripture during this year's mass of darkness. Be sure to deliver this scripture to him.
