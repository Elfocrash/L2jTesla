Soon we will hold the <font color="LEVEL">mass of darkness</font> in honor of Gran Kain of the darkness and Shilen, the mother of the abyss. This mass is the most sacred religious ceremony of our race. The Human Mystics of the Ivory Tower who attended last year's mass were awed at the size and magnificence of the mass. This year's mass will be no less grand. The clergy of the temple are very busy with preparations.<br>
We must fetch a few things from the village that are needed during the mass. We are short on help, so I would like to ask you to deliver those items for me. Do you think you could spare the time?<br>
