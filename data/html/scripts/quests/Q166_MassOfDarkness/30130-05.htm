<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Don't return unless you have all the items that I have asked for. Don't tell me that you have forgotten what you must bring back? I will tell you one more time, so pay attention. Get the ceremonial dagger from Iria of the weapons shop, the wine from Dorankus of the warehouse, and Garmiel's Scripture from Master Trudy of the House of Elders. I hope you will not ask me again.
