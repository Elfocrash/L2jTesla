<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>
Take this letter and bring me the items from the village. You must seek out three people -- <font color="LEVEL">Iria</font> of the weapons shop, <font color="LEVEL">Dorankus</font> of the warehouse, and <font color="LEVEL">Master Trudy</font> of the House of Elders. Bring the <font color="LEVEL">ceremonial dagger</font> used during the ceremony from Trader Iria, the <font color="LEVEL">wine</font> that I entrusted a few years ago from Warehouse Keeper Dorankus, and <font color="LEVEL">Garmiel's Scripture</font> from Master Trudy.<br>
I'm sure it's not a difficult task, going around and collecting supplies? I will not tolerate mistakes. Don't worry, I'll reward you as soon as the job is completed.
