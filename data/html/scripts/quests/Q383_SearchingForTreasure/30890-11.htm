You should thank your lucky stars for running into me. Why? Because I'm the only person in the world who can decipher this Map.<br>
I recently purchased Zaken's journal from some adventurers who had been exploring on Devil's Isle. It contained a detailed description of the method of decoding the pirates' jargon. Although Zaken was a seemingly fearless pirate who dominated all the great oceans, he was an unexpectedly cautious individual. He wrote a very detailed explanation of the code in his journal, as though he was afraid of forgetting how to decipher it...<br>
Now, I've told you everything I know. Come on, show me the Map. Let's find out where the treasure is hidden!<br>
These are the coordinates on the Map. Let me see... 12 feathers of parrot... 50 glasses of rum... the coordinates are...<br>
Oh, it's right there! It is the northern part of Alligator Beach! Ha ha! It's not far from here. I will mark it on your Map.<br>
Phew... all my life I have followed the legend of Zaken... And now my fate is just to interpret the Map for someone else... What a disappointment! Well, all I can do is ask you to be a brave treasure hunter...<br>
Now, get going! Find the finale of the legend... Ah! One last piece of advice... To open a Treasure Chest you must first obtain a <font color="LEVEL">Key of Thief</font>!
