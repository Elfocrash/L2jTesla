<html><body>Trader Espen:<br>
As a way of escaping my boring daily life, I have a hobby of collecting pirate memorabilia. I'm especially interested in anything to do with Zaken, the legendary scourge of the high seas.<br>
Currently, I'm conducting research about Muska, Zaken's subordinate who stole his treasure and ran away. It is said that he was once Zaken's boatswain, and when Zaken's ship was anchored at Innadril Harbor, he made off with a few Treasure Chests and stashed them somewhere on Alligator Island. Isn't that interesting?<br>
Soon, I plan to organize an expedition and go look for the treasure. Of course, I will need to hire seasoned adventurers...<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character who possesses the Pirate's Treasure Map and whose level is 42 or above.)
