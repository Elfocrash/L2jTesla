Do you mean it? Are you sure you won't regret your decision? Here... Here is 1000 adena. Ha! Finally, I have Muska's treasure Map! This is truly the chance of a lifetime. At last, Lady Luck smiled on me. I can give up my job as a trader and just enjoy being filthy rich!<br>
Let me see... where would the treasure be...? First I must decipher the pirates' jargon...<br>
Hmm? What are you still doing here? Go away! This Map is mine! You're an adventurer, so go and have one!
