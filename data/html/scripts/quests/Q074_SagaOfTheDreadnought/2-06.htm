<html><body>Guard Ulrich:<br>
 The Tablets of Vision contain the secret power of the gods. They were divided and scattered throughout the world. Each must be paired with its own Resonance Amulet before the information within can be accessed.<br>
The first tablet can be found on the south side of the Tower of Insolence. The Resonance Amulet for that tablet was left with me by Miss Leona.<br>
I'll give it to you. While I'm at it, I should tell you about a book called <font color="LEVEL">"The Army of the White Wings"</font>. It describes the guardians that Miss Leona encountered while she was on the pilgrimage of the stone tablets. You may run into them as well, and should learn all you can about them.</body></html>
