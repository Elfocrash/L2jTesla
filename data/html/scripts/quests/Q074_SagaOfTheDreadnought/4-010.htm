I was suspicious for a while. Why, at that time, did the fire dragon come to me? What woke that beast from its sleep...? Especially damning was the fact that the seal of Shilen was broken!<br>
The era of chaos... The period the dragon warned about, had arrived at last. In times of chaos and violence, the most important thing to me was the power to realize my intentions...<br>
All the evil creatures and spirits were saying the same thing. Although Valakas was silent on the matter, I knew the truth. He wanted to tell me that if we were to realize the peace I sought, I needed a power that could shape things to my will.<br>
That applies to you as well! A Warlord can fight against multiple enemies. The more powerful a Warlord is, the fewer losses he suffers. I'll probably end up in hell for the deaths I'm responsible for, but still I continue, creating more death and destruction.<br>
No one dares challenge me!<br>
Take this last Resonance Amulet... It will give you a new understanding. Complete the last communion and then visit Master Aiken in Aden Castle Town. Farewell!<br>
