She asked me to keep the Resonance Amulet until someone worthy came to me for it. She also says that it's not complete. To make it perfect you will need a <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>! There are two pieces held by opposing forces, the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos. Both threaten Goddard.<br>
Bring back either of the stones. It won't be easy! You must earn their absolute trust. Which side will you choose?<br>
