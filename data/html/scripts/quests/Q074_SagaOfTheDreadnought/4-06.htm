 Good job!<br>
 Pleased to meet you. I'm Leona Blackbird. Some call me such things as the Bride of the Fire Dragon, but believe me, I never married Valakas!<br>
Ha! At one time I was captain of the guard in Giran. That's when the fire dragon told me about this pilgrimage, which I didn't follow at that time. I didn't expect Sighardt Ein to attack at a time like that.<br>
 When I think back on it now, I understand. I've been expecting someone like you to come looking for me.<br>
