You've got some nerve addressing an elder like that!<br>
So, you want to broaden your horizons, eh? Ha! Even if you could afford to travel, Maphr couldn't keep you safe out there!<br>
I admire your courage and ambition, but it takes more than those things to travel, my friend! I'll tell you what!<br>
Pass a <font color="LEVEL">Test</font> that I give you and I'll pay your way to Giran. Do you understand?<br>
All I ask is that you obtain the endorsement of <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Reed</font>. I must warn you, he's not easily impressed. Now get going!
