Go to the woods and strike down any balor orcs you meet! Someone with your skills can easily take care of the Balor Orc archers, but the fighters and leaders are much stronger than regular balor orcs, so do not let your guard down!<br>
Tetrarch Vellior made a proclamation just a few days ago. The more balor orcs that are killed, the greater reward he will give. Slay the balor orcs and bring back something to serve as proof of your deed. The archers carry <font color="LEVEL">feather amulets</font>, while the fighters and leaders wear a <font color="LEVEL">necklace crafted of bone pieces</font>. If you collect these and bring them to me, I will give you a reward according to the number of items you present.<br>
Excellent! May you go forth in the name of Shilen and present fear as dark as the abyss and a death as cold as the deep lakes to those invaders who have violated our land!
