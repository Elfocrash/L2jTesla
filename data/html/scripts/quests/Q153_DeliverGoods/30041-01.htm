<html><body>Guard Arnold:<br>
Following the war with Gracia, our king issued a trade embargo, and trade with Gracia was stopped altogether. That's why Gracian trade ships cannot be seen nowadays. On those days that the grand, magnificent Gracian trade ships slowly sailed into the harbor, the village people would all come out to the docks and greet the ship with enthusiastic waves ...<br>
Lately there have been many trade ships coming in from Giran. But compared to Gracia, it seems that they are inexperienced when it comes to navigation. The recent storms have caused numerous trade ships to be shipwrecked on the southern shores of the island. Fortunately, none of the crew were killed, but even we guards had to be called out to collect the sunken trade goods.<br>
We're just about finished organizing the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships, but the task of delivering the goods to their respective owners still remains. We're still short on help. Do you think you can help us out?<br>
