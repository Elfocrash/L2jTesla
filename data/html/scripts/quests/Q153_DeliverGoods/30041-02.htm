Here is the list of all the townspeople you must deliver items to. It's that simple! I'll figure your wages based on how well you do.<br>
That Heavy Wooden Box goes to <font color="LEVEL">Merchant Jackson</font> at the Weapons Shop, the Fabric goes to <font color="LEVEL">Merchant Silvia</font> at the General Store, and that Clay Pot goes to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Lant</font>. Deliver those items and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">receipts</font>. Thank you!
