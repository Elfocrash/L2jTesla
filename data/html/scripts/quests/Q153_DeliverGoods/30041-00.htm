<html><body>Guard Arnold:<br>
These days, no trade ships bearing the flag of Gracia sail into the dock. That's because all trade with Gracia has been halted since the war. It was quite a sight to see the great trade ships slowly sail into the harbor with their horns sounding, but I guess we won't be seeing any of that anymore. Instead, there has been an increase in trade ships coming in from Giran.<br>
However, the recent storms have caused numerous Giran trade ships to be shipwrecked on the island's western shores. Fortunately, none of the crews were lost, but even we guards had to be called out to collect the sunken trade goods.<br>
Now we have to organize the goods that were on the shipwrecked ships. As soon as we organize them, we will have to deliver the goods to their respective owners. I hope you can help us when the time comes.<br>
