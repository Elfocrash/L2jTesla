Ah, you're back! Did you bring the <font color="LEVEL">new model Calculator</font>? Not yet? Why not? As I said, you should check with the <font color="LEVEL">Trader Guilds</font>. I am sure they brought it into the village. If you keep looking you will find it.<br>
Surely you know by now that the guilds you should check with are the <font color="LEVEL">Silver Scale Guild</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Golden Wheel Guild</font>...<br>
Get going!
