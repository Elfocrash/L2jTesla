Ha! Too much for you, eh? Don't worry, you passed the test... Why do you look so surprised? Your willingness to admit that your calculation skills are weak tells me that you and I share a common bond.<br>
I have tried and tried to reach to moon, and every time, total failure! Whoa! Who can say a genius like myself can fail! There was no failure! How can you hope to accomplish anything if you are constantly living in fear of failure?<br>
How dare you call me a failure!<br>
