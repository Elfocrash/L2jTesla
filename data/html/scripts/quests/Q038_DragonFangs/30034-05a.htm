Come in! Have you completed your mission? I'm impressed! What? You haven't collected all of them yet?<br>
If we are to cancel the sorcery of the Langk lizardmen, you must bring me <font color="LEVEL">50 dragon teeth</font>. Get them from <font color="LEVEL">Langk Lizardman shamans and leaders</font> that can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">deepest parts of the Langk Lizardman Dwellings</font>.<br>
