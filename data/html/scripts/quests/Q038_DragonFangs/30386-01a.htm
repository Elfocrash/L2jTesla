Your face is unfamiliar. You must be traveling through here.<br>
I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have ol mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us, now the lizardmen have joined in!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">highway of the southern shoreline</font> that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by <font color="LEVEL">Langk Lizardman</font>. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We need more experienced help.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 19 and above.)
