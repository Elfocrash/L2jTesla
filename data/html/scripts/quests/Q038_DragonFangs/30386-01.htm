<html><body>Guard Luis:<br>
I've been looking for someone like you.<br>
I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have Ol Mahum Stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us. Now the lizardmen from the south!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">highway of the southern shoreline</font> that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by <font color="LEVEL">Langk Lizardmen</font>. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards are already stretched thin.<br>
Will you help us?<br>
