Can you really do that for me? Thank you so much!<br>
Please take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad in the Town of Gludio</font>. Bring me his reply as soon as possible. You can find him if you follow the road in a northeast from here. Miss Richlin can get you there faster through the gate of time and space.<br>
This sorcery will only grow more dangerous over time. I'll make preparations until your return.
