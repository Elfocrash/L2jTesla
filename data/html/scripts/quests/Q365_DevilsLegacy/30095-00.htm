<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Randolf:<br>
Have you heard of the notorious Pirate Captain Zaken? His dogged pursuit of <font color="LEVEL">treasure</font> led him to a rocky island now called "Devil's Isle." His increasingly eccentric behavior caused him to lose the confidence of his crew, and they marooned him there.<br>
In despair, Zaken turned to the forces of darkness, who gave him the power to kill and imprison the souls of all of those who betrayed him. Even now, the souls of those damned warriors roam that barren place.<br>
There is more you should know, but you are not yet ready.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 39 or above.)
