Are you collecting <font color="LEVEL">Pirate's Treasure Chests</font>? Bring me one and I'll open it for you. All I ask is that you pay for making the key. <font color="LEVEL">It costs 600 adena.</font><br>
However, you should know that this chest carries a curse. <font color="LEVEL">You must be willing to risk receiving the curse.</font><br>
