<html><body>Grocer Pano:<br>
Well, you see, when the river became clotted with salmon, inland <font color="LEVEL">bears</font> started coming down to the river to gorge themselves. It was inevitable that they would clash violently with the fishermen there. Consequently my fishing resort was forced out of business, and I'm stuck with this huge stock of fishing gear!<br>
Would you be interested in earning some money? Please hunt down and kill the bears. I will pay you well!<br>
