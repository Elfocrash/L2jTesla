I am beside myself!<br>
Would you mind if I tell you my problem? Recently the salmon population in <font color="LEVEL">river to the west</font> of this village has exploded. This is not even the spawning season and yet all the fish are returning at once. I feared that this may be an omen of bad things to come, but the businessman in me saw a great opportunity. In spite of my reservations I started selling fishing gear and opened a resort.<br>
Sounds great, right? Well, the problem is...<br>
You know, I don't really feel comfortable talking about my problems with you. Why don't you come back when you've had more experience. I will have something to ask of you then.<br>
