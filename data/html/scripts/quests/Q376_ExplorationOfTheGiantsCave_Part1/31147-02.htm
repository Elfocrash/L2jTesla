<html><body>Head Researcher Sobling:<br>
To explore the Cave of Giants I must organize a large team. Funding will not be easily secured. The guild looks at this project quite skeptically. If only they understood how important this research is!<br>
I believe that if some valuable ancient relics were found there, they would change their mind. Please help me.<br>
