<html><body>Chief Summoner Kinsley:<br>
Well..., shall we look at your records? You graduated from Einhovant's School of Magic, attained a Wizard''s license at Gludio Temple, passed the Test of the Summoner with flying colors and even received a Recommendation letter from Galatea!<br>
Your record is flawless! However, it's been pointed out that your research activities have been somewhat sluggish since you were promoted to Warlock. Please work harder. Eventually, I'm going to recommend you be a candidate for <font color="LEVEL">Arcana Lord</font>, the ultimate summoner!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Warlock of level 76 and above.)
