Meow, even the remedy found in the hot spring region couldn't lift the curse. This is so sad, Meow! When will my master be transformed back into his regular form?<br>
Although the curse wasn't lifted, thank you very much for helping my master, Meow! My master has ordered me to help you! My master has already figured out a way to decipher the hieroglyphs on the 'Tablet of Vision!' My master is a great wizard who is well acknowledged by the elder statesmen of the Ivory Tower! This is not a problem for him! This is what my master told me:<br>
'Sparky, the gods would actually prefer it if we did not master the highest level of magic. It's because human beings too easily fall into the trap of arrogance and self-righteousness. The gods remember all too well the Baium and Beres incidents.<br>
That's why they divided the tablet, which was originally used by the giants to teach magic. They created six pieces and changed the letters written on the tablet to match the letters of the gods.'<br>
So I asked my master, Meow! 'Master, does that mean that no one can obtain the knowledge contained in the tablets?' And my master replied, 'There is actually a way.'<br>
