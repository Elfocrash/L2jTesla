Sparky told me about you... you're that friend of Keats, aren't you?<br>
Poor Keats... He just wouldn't take no for an answer... I finally had to turn him into a frog! Did a good job of it, too! Even the Grand Magisters can't reverse the spell!<br>
Sigh... I tried everything, but the poor little fellow just hopped away in disgrace!<br>
I've got a marvelous idea! Why don't you become an Arcana Lord? Maybe then, you could reverse my wicked spell!<br>
