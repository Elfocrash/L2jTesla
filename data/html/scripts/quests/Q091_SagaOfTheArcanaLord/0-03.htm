 Ask <font color="LEVEL">Sparky the Cat</font>, Keats's servitor, where his owner is. He's probably in Goddard Castle Town. It's pretty smart for a low-level spirit, so it should be helpful to you.<br>
Take this report with you. It's the document Keats was working on before he disappeared. It's about the spirit protecting one of the six tablets. Please read it, you'll be facing that monster one day soon!<br>
You'd better get going! Good luck!</body></html>
