 Gulp~!<br>
 Hmm...<br>
I'm not feeling anything...<br>
Am I? I guess it's not working, eh?<br>
Another failure! Sigh! But I'll never give up! I'll just find another way!<br>
 Thank you so much! It didn't work, but it certainly boosted my confidence! I've decided to forget this stupid curse and go see Belinda as soon as possible! Now take this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Sparky the Cat</font>. I've told him to tell you how to become an Arcana Lord. He's very smart! Good luck!</body></html>
