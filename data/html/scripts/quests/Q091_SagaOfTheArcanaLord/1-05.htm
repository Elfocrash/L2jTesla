 Well, it's obviously no good to me in my current state... Ribbit! Oh, excuse me! How embarrassing!<br>
Ah, ha! You're trying to become an Arcana Lord, too, aren't you? Have you spoken with Sparky? I was following the same path, but due to my present condition, I've had to postpone my plans! Ribbit!<br>
 Please help me lift this curse! In return, I'll tell you how to become an Arcana Lord. I've got much more important things that I must deal with now. I must confess my love for Belinda, the lady who captured my heart, and propose to her as soon as possible, but first I must free myself from this blasted curse! Dammit!<br>
 I came to this hot springs area in search of <font color="LEVEL">Ice Crystals</font>, a wonder drug that may lift the curse! Could you help me to find some? Help <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font> over there with his soy sauce and he'll tell you where to find ice crystals. Ribbit!</body></html>
