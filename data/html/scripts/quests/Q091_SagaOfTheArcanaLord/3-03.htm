First, you must speak with <font color="LEVEL">Messenger Naran Ashanuk</font> of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to earn their trust!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Soul Guide Udan Mardui</font>, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos, has something they call the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>. You must get it from them!<br>
If things don't go well with the Varka, you should try the Ketra Orc tribe. They also have one of the stones. Good luck!</body></html>
