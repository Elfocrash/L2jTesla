<html><body>Chief Summoner Kinsley:<br>
No book or scroll speaks of the ultimate summoning spell. That information has always been restricted to the gods, far beyond the grasp of mere Humans. The secrets are supposedly written on six ancient tablets, in the language of the gods. The gods put these tablets in very out-of-the-way places, and stationed formidable beasts nearby to guard them.<br>
If you can learn the secrets of the six tablets, you will pass the test to become an Arcana Lord. Two people left to take this test before you, but Belinda sent me a letter saying that she wanted to give up, and I haven't heard from Keats for some time. He's a well-known playboy, and I'm worried that he's in trouble... You must meet them first.<br>
