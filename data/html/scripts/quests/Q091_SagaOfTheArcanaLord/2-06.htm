This precious stone is the answer! This is what my master said, Meow!<br>
'Sparky, this is a precious stone called the Resonance Amulet. You can decipher the gods' letters on the Tablet of Vision if you use its power. Furthermore, you intuitively know where the tablet is hidden if you hold this stone in your hands.'<br>
So I asked my master, Meow! 'Master, who made this remarkable stone?' And my master said,<br>
'Well, I'm not sure who made it...But one thing is for certain. Someone is helping us so that we, human beings, can gain the knowledge forbidden by the gods. I don't want to miss this great opportunity as someone who is searching for knowledge.'<br>
Meow! I'm going to entrust you with this Resonance Amulet that my master used! You have to become Arcana Lord on behalf of my master, Meow! You can find the first Tablet of Vision if you follow the Resonance Amulet! Good luck!</body></html>
