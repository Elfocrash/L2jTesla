<html><body>Tablet of Vision:<br>
When you hold the Resonance Amulet in your hands and concentrate, the Tablet of Vision is slowly surrounded by bright light. Hundreds of voices begin pounding in your head... they seem to be reading some form of scripture, a scripture that reveals a great and horrible truth. Ah, the fundamental truth of all things is revealed! But wait, I can't understand any of it! Amid the voices, you recognize a whisper of a woman that you think you've heard before, but it fades quickly.<br>
 You begin to understand where the next Resonance Amulet is... a temple in Goddard Castle Town... an Elf lady with a petite body... she must be Summoner Belinda that Keats told you about. You feel the power of the Resonance Amulet from her.<br>
 The images fade and the light turns to darkness..</body></html>
