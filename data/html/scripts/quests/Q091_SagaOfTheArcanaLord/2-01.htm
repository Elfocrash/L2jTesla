Meow. Kinsley sent you here, didn't he? Are you training to become an Arcana Lord just like my master?<br>
But my master...my master was...<br>
...cursed and turned into a frog! Miss Belinda whom my master had loved for a long time put him under a curse by chanting an ancient spell! She turned him into a frog just because she couldn't accept his love~! Belinda was too cruel, Meow~!!<br>
Please, Meow~ Help me lift the curse, Meow!<br>
