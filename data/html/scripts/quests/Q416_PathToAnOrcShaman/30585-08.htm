Now I will make you a totem mask from the Kasha Bear Pelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk you brought. It will enable you to learn the language of flame when you meet our Hestui Totem Spirit.<br>
The Fiery Egg you obtained from the Scarlet Salamander contains an unborn spirit whose existence is not yet ordained. It is truly a valuable item, fit to offer to the Totem Spirit as a gift.<br>
Now go to the Ruins south of the Temple of Pa'agrio and seek the <font color="LEVEL">Hestui Totem Spirit</font>. Dejakyar Lamme! May the eternal flame guide your path.
