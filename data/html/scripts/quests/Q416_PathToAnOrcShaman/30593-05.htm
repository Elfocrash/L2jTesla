<html><body>Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:<br>
Well done indeed, young shaman. I will firmly seal it away so it does not escape a second time from my web to spread evil forces in the world ...<br>
Did you know, all the spirits that move the world with unseen powers were caught in my web at one time or another. As the price for freeing them, I asked for their names. That is how I came to know the names of the ninety-nine spirits.<br>
The name of all the spirits is contained in a drop of blood from the tip of my foot. I will give this to you. Take it to <font color="LEVEL">Seer Umos</font> and perform a ritual with the blood in your mouth to receive the secret of the spirits.
