I will put the grizzly's blood you have brought in this cauldron. Take this to the<font color="LEVEL"> Duda-Mara Totem Spirit</font>. If it tries to threaten you, quickly offer the cauldron as a gift. If you are a single second late, you may spend eternity tied up in its spider web.<br>
When you offer the blood as a gift, ask to be taught about the names of the spirits ... You must keep this in mind.<br>
The totem spirit is located north of the Arena in Gludin Village. Well then, I hope you return having learned the secret of the spirits. May the divine protection of flame be with you.
