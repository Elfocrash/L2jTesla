<html><body>Seer Umos:<br>
All those that manage the names of spirits, those that spin the spider web of time and space, we receive the secret of the spirits contained in the blood of the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit. You, young shaman, have received the true authority of flame to be able to call the names of spirits and control their power.<br>
Now take this mask. It is a token that shows you have earned the qualifications to become a shaman. Congratulations, singer of chants! Take the mask and go to the high prefect to change profession to Orc Shaman. Tejakar Pa'agrio! May the flame guide you to the path of righteousness.
