<html><body>Seer Umos:<br>
To meet an Orc brother in such a foreign place as this, I am truly glad to see you. From Tataru's letter, I see you have received the language of flame from the Hestui Totem Spirit. You have passed the first step in becoming an Orc shaman.<br>
However, to become a true Orc Shaman, you need more than just the ability to speak the language of the spirits. To control the spirits and rule their power, you must be able to shout out their names.<br>
However, I cannot teach you the <font color="LEVEL">ninety-nine names of the spirits</font> nor are they recorded anywhere. To learn them you must meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, which is called the "one that holds names." The spider web of time and space that he has spun meets various places in the continent, and one of those places is Gludio.<br>
Before you meet the Duda-Mara Totem Spirit, you must prepare some things. Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">grizzly bear</font> which lives in Gludio and bring back its blood. When you have collected three full bottles of blood, then bring them back to me.
