... Why, isn't this the fiery egg! Where did you find such a valuable item? I, the guardian spirit of the Hestui, am greatly pleased with your gift ...! I will watch over the egg with delight, waiting for the birth of a new flame spirit ... Will it be a bird of flame? Or a bright blazing lizard of fire? Indeed, I am curious!<br>
... growl ... Then I will give you a gift in return. Take this claw ... If you prick your tongue with it and let the blood run, you will be able to speak the language of the spirits ... Take it to <font color="LEVEL">Tataru Zu Hestui</font> and perform the ritual.<br>
... growl ... Well then, may the blessing of the guardian spirits be with you, offspring of Hestui!
