<html><body>Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:<br>
... If you want, I will teach you ... But I must ask a favor in return ...<br>
... One of the evil spirits I sealed in my web of space and time has escaped ... I have come all the way here to Gludio to catch that scoundrel ... Impertinently, it is hiding in the body of my offspring ...!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Poison spiders, arachnid trackers</font>, all my adorable children ... The <font color="LEVEL">Durka Spirit</font> that I seek is hidden in my children's bodies.<br>
... You must hunt spiders and make it reveal itself ... Take this spider web of space and time that I have spun. When you have pinned the Durka Spirit down, seal it in this net and bring it to me. Then I will teach you what you wish to learn.
