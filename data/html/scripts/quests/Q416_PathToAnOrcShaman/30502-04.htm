I see you have not left yet. Find the <font color="LEVEL">Duda-Mara Totem Spirit</font> and learn the names of the spirits. Only then, will you acquire the true power of a shaman and be able to change profession to an Orc Shaman. The totem spirit is located north of the Arena in Gludin Village. Dejakyar Lamme! May the protection of flame be with you.
