<html><body>Dead Leopard's Carcass:<br>
<center>[A ghost is much like a fire:<br>
approach it with great care,<br>
a proper distance bear,<br>
and grow as warm as you desire.<br>
But stray too close to the source,<br>
And it will eat you whole;<br>
For ghosts and fiery coals,<br>
Have no means to restrain their force.<br>
Remember the teachings of Pa'agrio!<br>
Remember the Song of Fire!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">In order to hear the last teaching,</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Drench your hands once more with the blood of the Black Leopard!]</font></center>
