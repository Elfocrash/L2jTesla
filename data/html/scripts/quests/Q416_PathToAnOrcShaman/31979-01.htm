Congratulations, young Orc, on taking the first step in this world!<br>
I want you to learn here in Schuttgart how to inherit the wisdom of the souls!<br>
Behold this Black Leopard in front of me! He's the Gandi Totem Spirit, the wisest of all Totem Spirits!<br>
Talk to him and receive his knowledge! He'll help you!
