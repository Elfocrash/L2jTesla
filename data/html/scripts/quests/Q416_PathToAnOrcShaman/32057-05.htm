Ha!<br>
Well, there's no need for you to feel pain, young Orc.<br>
From the time that Pa'agrio created you, you were supposed to be like this!<br>
The shape of burning fire is not one and the kind of fire is not one either.<br>
You've been cleansed with the blood of Gandi's family, now other Totem Spirits cannot ignore you... krrrr...<br>
Now, speak with Seer Moira over there. Since you have my wisdom, he'll lead you to a Shaman.
