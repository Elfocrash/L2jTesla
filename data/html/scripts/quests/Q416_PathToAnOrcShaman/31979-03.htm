<html><body>Seer Moira:<br>
I've watched you, young Orc...<br>
You learned the Language of Flame from the Hestui Totem Spirit and the wisdom of souls from the Gandi Totem Spirit.<br>
You're now a legitimate Orc Shaman! I'll give you this Mask of Shaman as proof.<br>
Take it to the High Prefect and you'll be able to transfer class. Again, congratulations, Tazakar Oroca!
