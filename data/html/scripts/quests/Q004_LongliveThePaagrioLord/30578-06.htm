Dekara Lamchar Kakai! As long as all the tribes stand united under the flag of our lord, the glory of our Orc Kingdom will never fade!<br>
I'm sure that you understand the importance of unity and loyalty to this mission. Treasure these two virtues throughout your life! Now, although this lesson is its own most valuable reward, I will grant you a small reward to thank you for working hard for our kingdom. Put it to good use.
