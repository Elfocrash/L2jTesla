<html><body>Trader Kunai:<br>
The Duda-Mara tribe is not vain or extravagant, and merely wishes for the health and well being of the Pa'agrio Lord with all our hearts. It's unbelievable, but they say that his healthy body has recently been seized by an illness. The elders of our tribe are very concerned, and offer him this mysterious medicine, <font color="LEVEL">spider dust</font>, that cleanses the body and mind of all impurities!<br>
We hunted the great spiders that live high on the mountaintop and dried their legs in the sun, then finely ground them into a powder. Its fragrance has the mysterious power of purifying what is unclean!
