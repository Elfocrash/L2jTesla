Now I can get started making Robe Armor. I'll need some D-Grade Crystals, but I know better than to ask a lightweight like you to bring them to me!<br>
Have your <font color="LEVEL">Sponsor </font>bring me<font color="LEVEL"> 771 D-Grade Crystals. </font>Stop whining! I'm not running a charity here!<br>
Oh, by the way... <font color="LEVEL">You've got to come back with your Sponsor</font>! How else would I know who your sponsor was?
