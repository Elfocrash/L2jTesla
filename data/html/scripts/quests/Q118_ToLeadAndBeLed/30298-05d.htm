Heavy Armor it is, then! I'll need some D-Grade Crystals, but I know better than to ask a lightweight like you to bring them to me!<br>
Tell your <font color="LEVEL">Sponsor</font> to bring me <font color="LEVEL">922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Stop whining! I'm not running a charity here!<br>
Oh, by the way... <font color="LEVEL">You've got to come back with your Sponsor</font>! How else will I know who to make the Armor for?
