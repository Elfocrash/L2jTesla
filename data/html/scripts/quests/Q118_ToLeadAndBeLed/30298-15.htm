Well, I have all the ingredients I need, but I have one more favor to ask of you... I want to test the bond between you and your Sponsor.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen Barracks</font> and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">King of the Araneid</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">all 8 of his legs</font>! Also, <font color="LEVEL">you must defeat the King of the Araneid while your Sponsor looks on!</font> Think of it as a way to prove yourself to him! Naturally, if you get in trouble, he'll be there to help you. This experience should be good for the both of you!<br>
I'll have your Armor ready when you return with the 8 Legs of the King of the Araneid.
