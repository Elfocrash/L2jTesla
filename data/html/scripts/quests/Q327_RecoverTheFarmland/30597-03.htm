Very well! Drive out the turek orcs that are camping around this area! If you bring the necklaces the orcs all wear, I will reward you according to the number.<br>
They may be lowly orcs, but they seem to have ranks among them. The one that seems to be the leader has a luxurious necklace. I will reward you a little more for that one.<br>
Ah! And as you know, this area was once the holy grounds for the ancient Elmoreden Empire. In the past, one could find three or four ancient relics each day when digging the earth to till the soil. Orcs also seem to understand about the value of those relics, and some collect them. Do away with the orcs and keep the relics that you find. You will be able to sell them for a high price at a store in the village.<br>
Now it is time for you to leave. Please make an effort to recover the land for the farmers that lost their way of life. May the blessing of the goddess be with you.
