You must be the mercenary sent by Guard Leikan. It is good to see you. I have a sad story to tell you...<br>
During the war with Gracia the farmers of this area were driven off of our land. After the war was over we returned to our farms only to find them occupied by Turek orcs!<br>
I'll give the Lord credit for his many restoration projects, but unfortunately we are far from the castle and haven't gotten any significant help from him. We must take responsibility for recovering our farms! Would you help us drive the orcs from our lands? You will be well compensated for you efforts.<br>
