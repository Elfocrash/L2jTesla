Wow! You have brought five pieces of bronze mirror fragments ... With this, I can restore the mirror as it is seen in this illustration ... This piece goes with this piece ... And if I connect it underneath with this ... And so! It is complete!<br>
Do you know? This mirror was used by the noblewomen of the Elmoreden age ... It contains the life of the ancient people ... It is a very precious relic ...!<br>
