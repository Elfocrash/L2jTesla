Eh? You caught them? Ah, it finally feels like a weight has been lifted! First of all let me offer you a reward equal to the number of necklaces you've brought. If you have more than 100 necklaces, I can also give you a bounty collected by our local merchants.<br>
Truth be told, I was prepared to offer the reward money myself, but when our merchants caught wind of your efforts, they insisted on contributing funds to the cause themselves. A noble act on their part, I dare say!<br>
It is entirely your choice whether to collect the per necklace bounty or accept the merchant's donation.<br>
