Gods be praised! Now that I know that you are willing to help us, I finally feel like I'll be able to sleep soundly tonight.<br>
According to a trustworthy source, the Elrokian thieves who raid our wharf all wear necklaces that contain a <font color="LEVEL">dinosaur fang pendant</font>. Bring me those necklaces as proof that you have captured them; I'll reward you based on the number of necklaces you bring. If you bring back more than 100 necklaces, I can also give you the donations collected from the merchants here.<br>
Please, whatever it takes, rid us of these troublesome thieves! As long as you bring me their necklaces, I'll make sure that you are well compensated for your time.<br>
The Elrokian raiders have set up camp in the <font color="LEVEL">Primeval Plains</FONT>. Travel south along this road, and I'm certain that you'll find them.
