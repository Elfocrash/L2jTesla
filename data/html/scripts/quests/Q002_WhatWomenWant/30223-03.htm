Before I tell you her name, you must promise me, for her honor's sake, that you will not utter her name lightly. It would be serious indeed if the lady's sacred honor is tainted in any way. Her name is <font color="LEVEL">Greenis</font>, but everyone calls her 'Greens Well' because her smile is as clear as the spring waters of the green fields. She is the beautiful woman that has ensnared my soul. My heart flutters as I think of her again.<br>
But I cannot tell her that I love her unless I can confirm that she also has feelings for me. It would be an incomplete, one way love. I agree with the ancient poets that a love that cannot be returned should not be declared aloud. Plus, I do not wish to burden the lady.<br>
... Thus, I need your help ... Please help me find out what Greenis thinks of me. I beg of you! If you truly believe in beautiful love, I believe you shall not turn down my plea.<br>
