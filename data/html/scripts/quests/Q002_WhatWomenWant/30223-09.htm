So... This is the way it ends... There is nothing I can do. Perhaps it would have been better to just contain my love within my heart. I guess that even this pain is a part of love. It is heartbreaking, but I've learned a priceless lesson, that the greater the longing, the harder it is to love, and that is why it is ever so much more painful...<br>
Here, take this... It's not much, but you've given me so much help in learning a little bit more about the pain of heartbreak, so please consider it a fee for my lesson and accept it.
