Arujien's Book of Poetry? Thank you.<br>
I must admit that I never knew that Arujien thought of me in that way. He was always very kind and I regarded him a good person.<br>
I must write a letter to Arujien to tell him that I appreciate his affection, but there is already someone else who has captured my heart...
