Whew ... again ...? Every year around this time there is always someone who falls for my sister ... but why do they all ask me? It has nothing to do with me. From what I know, my sister has no interest in love or courtship. And especially not for someone like Arujien.<br>
That's all I can tell you. But I may be wrong. I'm not that close to my sister. Perhaps Uncle <font color="LEVEL">Herbiel</font> would know what my sister is thinking right now. He's always taken care of Greenis like his own daughter.
