...You, have you ever passionately loved someone? Have you ever experienced a passion and affection towards a single person, emotions that exist every waking moment of your day? Now I understand why the poets call it a 'fever'. I...have fallen in love with a lady...<br>
I don't have the courage to go and confess my feelings for her, so I am writing a letter. I guess I will have to ask someone to deliver this love letter to her. It would be nice if I could find someone trustworthy. For the honor of the lady that I love, I need someone who can keep a secret.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Elven or Human character of level 2 and above.)
