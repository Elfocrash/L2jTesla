Give me the Scroll of Ancient Magic and step back...<br>
... the light of purification. It is cast on the shadows. The flames of soul... burning up the darkness...<br>
It's done. The magic is removed. Here is the <font color="LEVEL">Blank Scroll</font> I promised you.<br>
 This Blank Scroll will be helpful to you when you trade with the <font color="LEVEL">Merchant of Mammon</font> who appears in the sacred area once in a while.<br>
If you would like to collect more Blank Scrolls, enter the sacred area, slay the <font color="LEVEL">guardians of ancient cult</font> and bring me back more <font color="LEVEL">scrolls of ancient magic</font>.<br>
