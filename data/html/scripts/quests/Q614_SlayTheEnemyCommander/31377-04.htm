<html><body>Chief Ashas Varka Durai:<br>
Are you ready? You've already defeated Hekaton, hero of the Ketra, you should be able to defeat Tayr as well!<br>
Tayr is the commander of Ketra forces. He's a typical savage, little more than a beast! He has cruelly massacred hundreds of Varka soldiers! He must be stopped! Kill Tayr, cut off his head and bring it to me!<br>
Bear this in mind! Commander Tayr is every bit as powerful as Hekaton! You're strong but you can't fight him alone! Take some friends with you!
