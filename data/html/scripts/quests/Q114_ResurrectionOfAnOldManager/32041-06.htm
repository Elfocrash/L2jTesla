Ah, that's right. I was talking about the incident at the lab.<br>
There was a great explosion in the north wing of the lab. After that, everything was in chaos. A gigantic golem suddenly appeared out of nowhere, forcing us to flee. By the time we returned, all of the golems we had made began attacking us.<br>
Everybody has since left this area except me.<br>
