Tejakar Oroka! Well done indeed, my young Orc! The crude item in your hand is a totem worshipped by the wolfmen! That is a great war trophy to commemorate this battle. But if you are not interested in trophies, you can sell it to the merchants. I heard some brothers will pay a fortune to get those trophies, maybe to show off their valor!<br>
The severed heads of the werewolves that you have brought back will be skewered on spears and placed outside the village. We will show the world the consequences of daring to challenge our race!<br>
But the maraku wolfmen will not retreat so easily! This is not the end of the war against them. You should take a short rest and restore your energy! However, keep your weapons greased and tighten the laces on your armor to remain always prepared to fight!<br>
