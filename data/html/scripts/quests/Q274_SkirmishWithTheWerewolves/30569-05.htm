Tejakar Oroka! Well done indeed, my young Orc! The severed heads of the werewolves that you brought back will all be skewered on spears and placed outside the village. We will show the world the consequences of challenging us!<br>
But the maraku wolfmen will not retreat so easily! This is not the end of the war against them. You should take a short rest and restore your energy! However, grease your weapon, tighten the laces on your armor so they do not become loose, and remain prepared to fight at any moment!
