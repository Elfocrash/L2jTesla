This Immortal Plateau has been the holiest land of the Orcs since ancient times! The place where our progenitor -- made by the great Pa'agrio of flame -- took his first steps, is none other than the Immortal Plateau. However, there is a group of fools that will not understand that this land belongs to us. These wolfmen call themselves <font color="LEVEL">maraku</font> and challenge us for our land.<br>
The Flame Lord Kakai sent an envoy to the wolfmen and politely asked them to leave this land! But they replied to his civil request by returning the envoy's head!<br>
How dare they repay our good will with blood! Blood for blood! As things have turned out this way, I of course cannot let a single werewolf live. The wolfmen brought this upon themselves! The lord has ordered us to punish these rash fools without pity. Young Orc! Will you not fight for the dignity of your race?<br>
