Flame Spirit Ajirua is preparing you for Khavatari's test.<br>
Here it is. The Ketra Orcs, a lower race who betrayed us long ago, and the Varka Silenos are at war. They each have a <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font>, but you must earn their absolute trust to get it.<br>
Bring either stone to pass the test.<br>
