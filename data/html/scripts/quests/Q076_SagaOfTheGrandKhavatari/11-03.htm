The power of the ancient Orcs that you seek was created by the gods, but stolen by devils.<br>
Find the <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font> inside the Four Sepulchers at the Human Imperial Tomb!<br>
If entering is too difficult, go to the Shrine of the Loyal and fight Halisha's minions! He'll show up if you kill enough of them.<br>
Defeat him and get the Resonance Amulet!</body></html>
