Congratulations. You have safely completed the test. The topaz that you brought will be used to make the Elven Knight Brooch, symbol of the Elven Knights. With this, you can prove your skills openly to the grand master.<br>
However, the Topaz Piece is not enough to complete the Elven Knight Brooch. Take this letter and go to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Kluto of the village of Gludin</font>. He will tell you how to make these jewels into an Elven Knight Brooch. If you don't know how to go to Gludin, ask Guard Praga.
