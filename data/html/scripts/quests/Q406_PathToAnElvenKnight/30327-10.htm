<html><body>Master Sorius:<br>
I see you have safely passed Kluto's test. Congratulations! You have proven that you have the courage to become an Elven Knight. This brooch is made of materials collected by other Elves who have gone through this same test. Another brilliant tradition of the Elven race is passed on to future generations!<br>
If you wish to change your profession to Elven Knight, give this brooch to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Rains</font>. Until we meet again, may the protection of Eva be with you!
