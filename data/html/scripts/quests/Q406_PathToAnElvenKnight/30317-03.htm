Why have you returned so early? Were you afraid? They are only Ol Mahum Novices... You are quite timid.<br>
If I may give you a piece of advice, don't go deep into the camp. If the Ol Mahum come upon you in a group, with your skills you'd never be able to deal with them. Do you understand what I'm saying? Well, be off now!
