The two documents you hold in your hands contain parts of the song of creation sung by the Gods in the beginning. I trust that you discovered the power of the precious phrases and the truth of authority as you read them one by one.<br>
Now I am giving you the <font color="LEVEL">Orb of Abyss.</font> With this, you have earned the qualification to become a Shillien Oracle. Take the Orb of Abyss and go to a Grand Master to request a change of occupation. If you speak to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font> over there, you can change profession right now.
