<html><body>Magister Talbot:<br>
I see you have found Andariel's Book. Did the lofty priests of Einhasad fall for it when you spoke of the books they had written? They are hypocrites, who forget that the vanity and arrogance that they say are sins are within themselves.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Now take Garmiel's Book and Andariel's Book to Magister Sidra</font> of the village of Castle Gludio. Then she will give you the Orb of Abyss, which is the token you need to change profession to Shillien Oracle.
