Why this is the prayer book that I wrote ... You have this too? This was published in the form of a book of poems with prayers I made to Einhasad when I was young. It became known among the younger generation through rumors, and now it is a book beloved by many people. It is embarrassing to be saying so myself, but many people were moved after reading my book and have come to the temple to follow the path of light.<br>
When I think that my humble writings have played a part in spreading the will of Einhasad in the world, I can only be joyful. And now those like you, who follow evil doctrines, are impressed by my book ...<br>
