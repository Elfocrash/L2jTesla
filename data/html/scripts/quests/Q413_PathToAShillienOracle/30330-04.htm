The "Orb of Abyss" that you carry is a token that shows you have completed all requirements and are eligible to become a Shillien Oracle. Take the orb to a grand master of the Dark Elven Guild and he will give you help in obtaining the enlightenment regarding the truth between light and darkness and thereby becoming a Shillien Oracle. If you go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font> just over there, you can change your profession immediately.
