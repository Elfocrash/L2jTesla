Have you ever heard of the demon <font color="LEVEL">dark succubus?</font> They were servants that lived in the ancient palace of darkness and waited on Gran Kain. They were made in the image of a Goddess and are like angels of beauty and wisdom.<br>
However, they were jealous of the power of the Gods and secretly eavesdropped on the songs Gran Kain sung in his palace, and wrote them down to use that power as their own. When Gran Kain discovered this, he was furious and cast away the servants, saying, <font color="F9AD81">'I will not steal back the secrets that you have overheard. However, to know the secrets, you will have to spill blood.'</font> The documents that the dark succubi made of the Gods' songs disappeared, but instead, when they died, their blood formed runes to write out the lyrics of the songs that they had overheard at the palace of Gran Kain.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you wish to complete Garmiel's book, you must collect the runes made by the blood of the dark succubus.</font> There are many dark succubi at the Spider Nest to the west of the Altar of Rites in the northern region. Kill them and find the Bloody Runes. Take these five blank sheets. If you put the scroll sheet near the blood, the blood will soak in and form runes. If you bring <font color="LEVEL">five Bloody Runes</font>, I will put the runes together to make you Garmiel's book.
