<html><body>Magister Sidra:<br>
I am a Sorceress who has taught countless magicians, and I can feel the magic power of those who stand before me. The power I sense from you seems to be less than that needed to become a Shillien Oracle. Train a little more and return to me when your understanding of magic becomes deeper.
