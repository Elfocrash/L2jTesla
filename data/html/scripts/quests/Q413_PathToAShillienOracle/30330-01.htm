<html><body>Magister Sidra:<br>
The Priests of Humans or Elves only look to the gods of light, and so their understanding is imperfect. The magic they use is only half and incomplete. However, the Shillien Oracles, the combat celebrants of the Dark Elves, understand both light and dark and command power from both. Not only do they cure and assist soldiers with the power of light, but they also curse enemies and steal vitality with the power of darkness.<br>
There is a ritual required when becoming a Shillien Oracle, to gain the knowledge of eternal darkness.<br>
