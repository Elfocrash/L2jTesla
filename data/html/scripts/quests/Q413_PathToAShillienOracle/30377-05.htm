May Shilen's blessing be with all those who search for the truth of darkness... I see you have brought back all five Bloody Runes. I will combine these and write out Garmiel's Book for you. It is only a small section of the song of darkness that Gran Kain sang in the beginning, but more will be revealed as your proficiency develops.<br>
Now take this. It is the completed Garmiel's Book. Read its passages as you rest during your journey, and adapt the truth within as your own.<br>
Now you must complete a second task in order to become a Shillien Oracle. You must find <font color="LEVEL">Andariel's Book,</font> which contains parts of the song of creation sung by the God of Light in the beginning. Take this book to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Adonius</font> in the temple of Einhasad. He will receive you cordially when you say, <font color="F9AD81">'I have read your book and, being deeply moved, I have repented of my sins and decided to accept the light.'</font>
