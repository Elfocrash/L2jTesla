Welcome, child of the light. The bone pieces of the departed souls that you have brought back will be given a proper funeral. This completes your atonement. Now you are ready to follow the path of light.<br>
Take this. It is <font color="LEVEL">Andariel's book</font>, the book you were looking for. It is a very precious book that contains parts of the song of creation sung by Einhasad, the god of light. May you always meditate on the creed of light within.
