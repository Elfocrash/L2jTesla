<html><body>Tetrarch Kaitar:<br>
I am a member of the Tetrarch council, but at the same time I am an Abyssal Celebrant. For the past 300 years, I have lived to fulfill the will of Gran Kain and Shilen. The goddess Shilen controls death and fate and sometimes lets us steal a glance at the future through death. The goddess taught me how to read the future by throwing bones of the dead and examining the shape they make when they fall on the ground.<br>
Once a month, I perform spells to foresee the dangers or disasters that will affect my race, and forecast the direction in which the Temple of Darkness must proceed. In days like these, when enemies that threaten our race are all around, it is my bounden duty to see whether there are any disasters or dangers in the future for my race.<br>
Every time I make my predictions, I need new <font color="LEVEL">bone pieces</font>. The older the bones are, the stronger the power of death that lies within them, so I can see the future more clearly. I would ask you to collect the bone pieces needed for my spell. Well, are you interested?<br>
