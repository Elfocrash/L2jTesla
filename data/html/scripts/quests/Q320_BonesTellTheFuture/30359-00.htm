<html><body>Tetrarch Kaitar:<br>
Shilen is the holy mother who created us Dark Elves from water. However, to foreign races like yourself, Shilen is only a fearful being that brings death. There is not a chance that an outsider who does not understand the truth hidden within the darkness of the abyss will assist me properly in what I do.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Dark Elven character.)
