<html><body>Tetrarch Kaitar:<br>
If you follow the road to the southwest section of the village, you will come to the abandoned <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font>. It was built a long time ago, for the greatest sorcerers of our race to study black magic. There, we developed a way to undo the curse on our race which made sunlight scorch our skin, and we also began studying spells to unseal our Hierarch. However, when we were at war with the Elves of Light, we abandoned the school for strategic reasons.<br>
We destroyed all the research materials so our magical results would not fall into the hands of our enemy. However, the few brothers who could not escape and were surrounded by the enemies put an end to their own lives and rose as the undead to fight the enemy until the end. The brothers who were sacrificed then still wander along the corridors of the Institute as <font color="LEVEL">skeleton</font> spirits. I would like you to bring me their <font color="LEVEL">bone pieces</font>. The bones of those who died in a war that was rampant with slaughter and death have especially strong black magic powers. I do not need many. Just find me <font color="LEVEL">ten</font>.
