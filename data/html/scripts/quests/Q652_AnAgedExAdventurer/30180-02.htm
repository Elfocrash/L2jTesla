I'm so sorry. I thought you were just a customer... You're the one who helped my father-in-law! Unfortunately, he was seriously injured on the way home by monsters! Luckily, he escaped with his life and he is now at home. But still, you helped him make it out alive. Thank you so much! (Because the old man was injured, you don't have the heart to ask for a reward.)
