Thank you so much... There is still chivalry left in this world! You've made me realize that I can still have adventures! I'll show those whippersnappers! It's so nice to meet someone like you who understands me..<br>
If you ever visit <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Oren</font>... speak with <font color="LEVEL">Grocer Sara</font>, my daughter-in-law. She's a good one who's always worrying about me... She'll reward you for your good heart.<br>
I'm going back home then...<br>
Good luck.
