Ah, you've been sent by Rockswell. Such fine, soft fur. I think we have plenty here. Please wait a moment, I will spin you that yarn right now.<br>
Here is your spool of yarn. I wonder, is Rockswell about to sew or something...<br>
Ah, and please tell Mr. Rockswell that I am knitting a woolen coat for him to wear this winter. It must be hard for him to weather the cold sea winds and guard the lighthouse all alone. Tsk tsk.
