<html><body>Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:<br>
Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins to the sea, but times have changed and there is no sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, we set afloat a boat that contains a doll in the shape of a Human maiden. Now we have to make that doll.<br>
I've asked Warehouse Keeper Rolfe, who is handy with his hands, to make the doll, but we still have to make the doll's long hair. For that, I need high quality fur yarn.<br>
Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font> on the island and gather about ten bundles of fur, then take them to <font color="LEVEL">Cristel</font> in the next village. You can find her at the well in front of the village warehouse. Give the fur to Cristel, and she will spin it into yarn. Take the yarn and give it to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Rolfe</font>. He will probably finish the doll on the spot. As soon as the doll is finished, bring it back to me. I will give you generous reward for your labor.
