<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Do you know about the Devastated Castle? It was built centuries ago to protect against the hordes of barbarians that were rampant even then. We were saved from the most recent invasion of the forces of Elmore by its mighty walls. Centuries of violent conflict have left it in ruins and haunted by the ghosts of the multitudes of warriors who met their bloody end there.<br>
These noble warriors deserve to rest in peace! If you meet anyone capable of taking on the powers of darkness, send them to me!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 60 and above.)
