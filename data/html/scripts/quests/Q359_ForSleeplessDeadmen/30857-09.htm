<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Oh, Einhasad! Here are your children. Their last battle has been won.<br>
Take them into your arms, into the world of the dead.<br>
Release them from their bonds and receive them into the bosom of Shilen.<br>
Give them eternal rest and happiness in your light.<br>
For those who grieve these brave warriors still, dry your tears, for now your loved ones are at peace...<br>
