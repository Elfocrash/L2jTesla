The purification ritual is over.<br>
I found a gemstone that was sparkling with a holy light. I think it must have been used by one of the fallen heroes of the castle.<br>
Perhaps they left it for you! Yes, I think they did! Why don't you take it?<br>
There are still many of our fallen comrades out there who have not been put to rest. If you want to help, come back and see me again.
