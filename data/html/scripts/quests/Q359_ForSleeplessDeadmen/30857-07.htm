<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
The Devastated Castle is northeast of here. There are many restless souls haunting that area. You'll find <font color="LEVEL">doom archers</font>, <font color="LEVEL">doom guards</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">doom servants</font>. Bring back <font color="LEVEL">60 of their remains</font>. Beware the doom knights, doom warriors and doom troopers who patrol there. They are former soldiers of Elmore. They won't let you free their minions easily...
