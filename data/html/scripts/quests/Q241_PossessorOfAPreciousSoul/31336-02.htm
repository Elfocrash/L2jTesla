Excellent! I need a very rare herb called Crimson Moss that can only be gathered once a year. I can tell you an easy way to get it, however. Go to the Swamp of Screams east of here and kill the Splinter Stakatos. Cut them open and you'll find the herb! I must have five units of it. May the Star of Destiny guide your path!
