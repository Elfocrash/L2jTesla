Of the seventeen of us, the Elf Witch Baraham was best at telling stories and keeping records. She kept journals even during our difficult travels. She can tell you where to find what Talien is looking for.<br>
One problem remains, she has turned into an evil creature and can't tell the stories anymore. She's the only one who knows what really happened, and it's heart-breaking.<br>
There is hope yet. She still has the records. Find her in a cave in the Bee Hive area and take them from her. That's all I know. Good luck!
