Have you heard the song about King Raul and the 5 clan members who helped him to unify the kingdom? Everyone in Aden knows that one! I'm afraid many of the details have been lost to history. It was a beautiful song, sung by the bards in the time of King Raul. Now it's been forgotten.<br>
I've heard that a Dwarven artisan in Heine has captured the song in an Echo Crystal. He's known as a Melody Maestro. Find him and bring me the crystal. It will be a great help.
