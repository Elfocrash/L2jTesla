I don't know if you met Gilmore, the Watchman of the Land Dragon Antharas. He's one of the Seventeen Nemeses. He sacrificed himself and became undead to monitor Antharas' movements in the Dragon Valley and to protect the seal made by the Founding Emperor Shunaiman. He would know what happened, he was there. It's dangerous, so watch yourself!
