Awesome! Thank you! Now, where should we begin? I suppose we should speak to the ones who know the story best.<br>
A descendant of one of the seventeen heroes is living in Giran Castle Town. Her name is Gabrielle. I couldn't even think of visiting her, since I'd have to cross the Death Pass. Would you visit her on my behalf? She probably has literature or materials related to her ancestor!
