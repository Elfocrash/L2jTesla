Our goals are to reinstate the Grand Olympiad from the forgotten age of the giants, to raise obelisks dedicated to heroes in each village and to restore the forgotten knowledge and culture of the past. Head Blacksmith Noel has been a great help in crafting the ancient weapons that are prepared for the heroes of the new generation. But lately, I think he has been having difficulty crafting the ancient weapons. He may need the help of a skilled person like you. Please go see Head Blacksmith Noel for your assignment.
