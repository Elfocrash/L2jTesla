In order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook, you must conquer the <font color="LEVEL">ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, the noble ant and the noble ant leader</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Check carefully any scraps of paper you come across</font>. The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be easy to identify.<br>
The spellbook has four chapters: <font color="LEVEL">the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth</font>. The contents will only be discernible if you recover all four chapters.<br>
This is a challenging task, but I think you are ready for it. May the divine blessing be with you...
