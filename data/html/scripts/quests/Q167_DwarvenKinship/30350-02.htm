<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Carlon:<br>
... It's been almost ten years since I was kidnapped and brought to this village ... Long ago, my entire family was nearly trapped by slave hunters, but they were able to escape when I allowed myself to be caught to buy them time. And so I was brought here. Fortunately, I am good at calculations, so the elders have entrusted me with the management of the warehouse. I have gotten rather used to this situation, I think ...<br>
But I miss my family, from time to time. However, I can't even dream of running away, because the sentry guards always keep a close watch over me. I write to my family whenever I think of them and ask kind guests to deliver the letters for me.<br>
And you ... you seem to be a kind and trustworthy type of person. Do you think I could ask you ... to deliver this letter to my family in my home far to the north ...?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 15 and above.)
