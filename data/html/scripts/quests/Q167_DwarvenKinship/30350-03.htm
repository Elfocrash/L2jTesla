<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Carlon:<br>
... It's been almost ten years since I was kidnapped and brought to this village ... Long ago, my entire family was chased by slave hunters. I bought some time for my family to escape but was caught, and brought to this place. Fortunately, I am good at calculations, so the elders have entrusted me with the management of the warehouse. I have gotten used to this situation, I think ...<br>
But I miss my family from time to time. However, I can't even dream of running away, because the sentry guards always keep a close watch over me. I write to my family whenever I think of them and ask kind guests to <font color="LEVEL">deliver the letters</font> for me.<br>
And you ... you seem to be very kind and trustworthy. Maybe you could do me a favor. This letter that I wrote to my family in my homeland far to the north ... could I ask you to deliver it?<br>
