Tsk tsk. Did you know already ...? My, how embarrassing ... We did not mean any harm, so please don't be offended. Actually, it's such an urgent letter ... I'm sure Haprock had no choice but to ask you. Usually, he would have delivered it through the guild carriage that travels regularly between the villages ... Please forgive us.<br>
Now! Please take this. It is a long standing tradition for us Dwarves to always pay when receiving aid from others. So don't refuse, just accept it!<br>
May the grace of Maphr be with you!
