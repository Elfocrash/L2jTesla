<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Haprock:<br>
First, take this! It may not be much, but please accept it as a token of thanks for your work. It is more than enough money to cover your travel expenses from the Dark Elf Village to here.<br>
And what I want you to do is ... deliver a letter to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Norman of the village of Gludin</font>. The letter came in a bundle of mail delivered from the Dwarven Kingdom a few days ago, and normally it would be sent on to Gludin on one of the carriages that will leave for Gludin in a few weeks. But I know how Norman is hungry for news from home, so I am asking you to deliver it now.<br>
Actually, Warehouse Keeper Norman has a wife at home who waits for her husband's return ... But Norman cannot return, as he has obligations to the guild ... They express their longing for each other by sending the occasional letter. A lonely man who longs for his wife in a faraway land ... doesn't that make your heart ache?<br>
So please, make sure to deliver this letter to Norman. He will be very thankful. Of course, he will compensate you for your efforts.
