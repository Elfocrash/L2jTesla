Ahh ... As I thought. You are a kindhearted person. This is a letter I wrote to my family. Take it. There is no need for you to travel all the way to the northern lands of the Dwarven Kingdom. Just deliver this to <font color="LEVEL">Haprock</font>, a Dwarf in the <font color="LEVEL">town of Gludio</font>. He will send my letter along on the coach that goes to my hometown. He will pay you as well. He is a generous person, and will reward you handsomely.
