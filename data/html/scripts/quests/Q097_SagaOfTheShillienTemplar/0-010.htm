<html><body> Master Galadrid:<br>
 You've already approached a higher level of knowledge than the other knights, but your ability hasn't reached the level of knowledge. Therefore, I can't give the title of Shillien Templar to you yet. Come back again after growing your ability more. (Only a character of level 76 or above can become a Shillien Templar. Be careful. You cannot change occupation if you stop Quest!)</body></html>
