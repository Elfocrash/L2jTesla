<html><body> Grand Master Samael:<br>
 Don't be so hasty! If you look carefully at the inscriptions on the relics, you'll discover how to find the Resonance Amulet. The <font color="LEVEL">Archon of Halisha</font> has the next Resonance Amulet.<br>
You can find the Archon inside the Four Sepulchers in the Imperial Tomb. You mustn't enter that dreadful place alone!<br>
If you're unable to form a party for some reason, massacre the Archon's minions in the Shrine of the Loyal. Kill enough of them, say around 700, and he will appear.<br>
His minions are called Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights and Shrine Guards.<br>
The Tablet of Vision that you seek can be found on the road to Goddard from the Wall of Argos.</body></html>
