<html><body> Grand Master Samael:<br>
 I need the <font color="LEVEL">Divine Stone of Wisdom</font> that's held by Asefa, the highest-ranking shaman of the Ketra Orcs, or Soul Guide Udan Mardui, the highest-ranking shaman of the Varka Silenos. You must gain the trust of the highest-ranking shaman of either tribe in order to get the stone. Which tribe do you wish to approach?<br>
