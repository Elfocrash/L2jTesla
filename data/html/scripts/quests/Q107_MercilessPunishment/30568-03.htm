Tejakar Oroka! Good! First, we must capture Baranka's followers!<br>
Once you catch them, do whatever you'd like with them! But first, find out what they are plotting, and report to me!<br>
Ask <font color="LEVEL">Centurion Parugon</font> about the traitor's followers! He is in the northern part of the village. Leave at once!
