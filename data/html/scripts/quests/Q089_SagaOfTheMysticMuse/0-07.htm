<html><body>Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
While fighting you, I came to a realization! I was wrong... I was just trying to hold onto my position. I'd forgotten what it's like to compete with powerful opponents, all determined to win first place! I realized that you could possibly be my equal! If I continued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I could maintain my strength! That's why I withdrew.<br>
Forgive me. And, thank you! Congratulations! You're officially a Mystic Muse!</body></html>
