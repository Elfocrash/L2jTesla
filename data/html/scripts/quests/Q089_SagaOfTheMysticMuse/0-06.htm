You've obtained the power of all the stone tablets! Good job!<br>
<br>
What? Why are you looking at me like that? You want the truth, eh? Very well. What did Feyshar tell you? Oh well, no use crying over spilt milk...<br>
Since I'm an Elf, I've always dreamed of being a top level wizard! You wouldn't believe what I've had to do just to get where I am now! But this isn't enough! I meant to stay on top forever! I couldn't allow anyone under me to grow stronger! That's why I tried to stop your class transfer...<br>
But you were tougher than I anticipated! The Fallen Angel Allector tried to stop you but failed. At the last stone tablet, I tried to stop you myself, but that busybody Feyshar interfered... I could've taken on both of you lightweights!<br>
