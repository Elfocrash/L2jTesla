<html><body>Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
While fighting you, I came to a realization! I was wrong... I was just trying to hold onto my position! I forgot what it was like to compete with many powerful opponents, all determined to win first place! I realized that, with practice, you could possibly be my equal! If I continued to fight young up-and-comers like you, I could maintain my strength! That's why I withdrew.<br>
Forgive me, and thank you! However I can't let you transfer classes yet. Improve your abilities and come back.<br>
(Only a character of level 76 or above can transfer to the Mystic Muse class. Don't abandon the quest until your class transfer is complete.)</body></html>
