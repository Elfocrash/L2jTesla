I didn't scare you off, huh? Well, I won't try to stop you.<br>
Just one more thing... The Tablet of Vision can't be read alone. Only by using the <font color="LEVEL">Resonance Amulet</font> can you decipher it. The Resonance Amulet acts as a medium, and you absorb the information directly into your body! This is known as <font color="LEVEL">communing with the stone tablet</font>. At one time Stones of Commune were quite rare, but they've been turning up in lots of places lately! I fear that there are unseen, foreign hands at work here...<br>
You should go and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Alminas</font> in Goddard Castle Town. He'll know best what you should do next... Take a copy of the guild bulletin with you!</body></html>
