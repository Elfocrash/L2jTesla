This is the very Silver Spear that King Astaire Van Halter bestowed upon Duke Adolph! It's the treasured heirloom of the Hellmann family! The lord will be overjoyed! The long lost honor of his family name is restored, and it's all because of you!<br>
Thank you. Please accept this small token of our gratitude! I only wish that we could have you over to the castle and give you a more formal recognition...<br>
I probably have to express our gratitude to the lord through another person, not me. Please talk with the village people.
