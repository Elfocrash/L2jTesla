Oh, the key? That's right! That's the key that Duke Adolph von Hellmann asked me to keep for him! That was a very long time ago! He told me that it guards the highest honor his family received from the King!<br>
But I can't go there. I can't leave this village.<br>
Go towards the northern part of the village. You'll find a box near the center of the Forest of the Dead. This key opens the padlock on the box.<br>
Bring me the object you find inside the box.
