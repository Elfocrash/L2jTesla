<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br>
You have found the Scepter of the Tantos tribe! I hope this appeases the angry souls of the Tantos ancestors, even if it does not entirely wash away all our sins.<br>
I have heard that the Ragna tribe was behind this whole thing. Is this true? First they betrayed us; now they challenge my authority. Soon the rivers will run red with their traitorous blood!<br>
You took this from one of the lower tribes, did you not? Did you first extract an oath of loyalty from them -- or punish them for their refusal? Ah, well done, Warrior! I remember how naive you were when we met after the completion of your training at the Temple of Pa'agrio. Now you have grown into a mighty champion!<br>
Your reward is my personal gratitude and this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Glory</font>, which you can use to transfer to a higher class. Now return to the Human lands and seek out your destiny! I am confident that you will bring great glory to our tribe, and that our paths will cross again.
