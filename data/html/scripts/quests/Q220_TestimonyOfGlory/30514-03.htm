<html><body>Prefect Vokian:<br>
Have you heard? All of the Orc seers agree that an eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long... We Orcs must prepare for dark days; days of chaos and destruction, dreadful days of endless war and disaster!<br>
People like you are indolent and weak. We are stronger than anyone else! We shall conquer the apostate tribes and reconstruct the <font color="LEVEL">great kingdom of Orcs</font> to fight the darkness of the chaotic days. Victory will be ours alone!<br>
