Have you heard? All of the Orc seers agree that an eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long... We Orcs must prepare for dark days; days of chaos and destruction, dreadful days of endless war and disaster! You must prepare yourself as well! This is the only was we can defeat the darkness that the Age of Chaos brings.<br>
(Quest for Orc characters of level 37 and above.)
