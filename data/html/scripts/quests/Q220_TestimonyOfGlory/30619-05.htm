Well done! I will <font color="LEVEL">return the scepter</font> as promised. I have no interest in the reunification of our ancient kingdom nor in the symbol of its authority. You noble Orcs will burn out and perish after foolishly fighting for the supremacy over the continent, and we shall survive for eternity!
