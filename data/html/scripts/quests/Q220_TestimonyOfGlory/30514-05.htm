Excellent! Now listen carefully to what I must ask of you...<br>
First you must find and kill the 'flying stone statue', known as <font color="LEVEL">Manashen</font>. He lurks near the Ivory Tower of Oren. Break him into pieces and bring 10 shards of his body back to me as proof!<br>
Next, in the Wastelands of Gludio you will find the so-called 'tyrants of the wild', the <font color="LEVEL">Tyrants</font>. Kill them and bring their claws back to me! You must bring at least 10!<br>
And finally, you must hunt and kill the 'guardian of barren earth', the <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Basilisk</font>. He can be found in the Corridors of Death! You must knock him down and bring back 10 of his teeth!<br>
For you who so perfectly embody the power and dignity of the Orc, this test should be almost effortless. Return promptly after completing your mission. I shall be waiting.
