<html><body>Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
The renegade Orc tribes you must find are the <font color="LEVEL">Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Tunath!</font> Five tribes all together! Ask <font color="LEVEL">Seer Manakia of the Town of Giran</font> about the Breka and Enku tribes! The other three tribes, the Vuku, Turek, and Tunath, will be found in the west. Ask <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Kasman of Gludin</font> for further information about them.<br>
Come back to me when you have recovered all of the seals from these lower Orc tribes! Now be on your way! For the honor of the greater Orc kingdom!
