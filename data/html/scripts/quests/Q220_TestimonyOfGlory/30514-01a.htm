<html><body>Prefect Vokian:<br>
Have you heard? All of the Orc seers agree that an eternal winter is approaching! It won't be long... We Orcs must prepare for dark days; days of chaos and destruction, dreadful days of endless war and disaster!<br>
You must prepare yourself as well! First you must complete an occupation change! This is no place for beginners.<br>
(Quest only for Orc characters who have completed occupation change and are above level 37.)
