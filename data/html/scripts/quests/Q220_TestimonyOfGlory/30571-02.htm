<html><body>Seer Tanapi:<br>
Many years ago our ancestors' tomb was desecrated and robbed by goblin grave robbers. They made off with the <font color="LEVEL">Scepter of Tantos</font>.<br>
As you know, the whole Tantos tribe was executed for high treason 100 years ago by order of the Lord Pa'agrio. Later it turned out that the charges were erroneous, caused by some wicked Dwarves' mischief. The Lord of Flame bitterly mourned his mistake. Each year we hold a memorial service to seek forgiveness from our wrongly executed brothers of Tantos and comfort their souls.<br>
If you recover the Scepter of Tantos, I am sure the Monarch will be very pleased. And the Mark of Glory will be yours for sure!<br>
