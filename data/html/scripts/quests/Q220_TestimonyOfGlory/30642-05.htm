Good work, Envoy of the Lord! I see you have recovered the <font color="LEVEL">Scepters of the Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Tunath tribes</font>! It shall not be long before all 108 Orc tribes are reunited under the Lord of Flame!<br>
Now is the time to face the <font color="LEVEL">Timak and Tamlin tribes</font> of the north! The last envoys I sent to them lost their heads! These tribes are savage beasts that have forgotten the most common courtesy! Fools that have forsaken the pride and identity of Orcs!<br>
A war has been declared to bring these tribes into the fold. You must join us in battle to prove your spirit and loyalty!<br>
