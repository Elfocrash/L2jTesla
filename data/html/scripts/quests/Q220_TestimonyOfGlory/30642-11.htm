<html><body>Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
Glorious Orc Warrior, you have fought well! You have displayed boundless courage in battle with the enemy!<br>
Now you must deliver the Seals of Flame you wrenched from the lesser Orcs to our Lord! He also wants the seals from the Tamlin and Timak tribes, but we must be satisfied with what we have at the moment!<br>
First, return to the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font> and see <font color="LEVEL">Seer Tanapi</font>. He will teach you the protocols you must use to present the seals to our Flame Lord!
