<html><body>Seer Tanapi:<br>
The goblin grave robbers were working at the behest of the Ragna tribe. The spirits of the wind whispered this into my ear. I don't have any information other than that the <font color="LEVEL">Chief or the Seer of the Ragna tribe</font> has the scepter.<br>
They are trying to conjure the spirit of the leader of the Tantos tribe. In fact, at this very moment, they are performing the ceremony somewhere on the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font>. You must find them, stop the ceremony, and get back the scepter! Hurry!
