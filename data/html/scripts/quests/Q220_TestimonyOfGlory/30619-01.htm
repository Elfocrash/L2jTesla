<html><body>Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
Oh oppressor of flames, why has such a noble person come to this obscure place? Have you come to meet me, Driko, leader of the Vuku tribe?<br>
Right now, I am facing a problem which could be a matter of life and death for my tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom.<br>
Unless you bring a <font color="LEVEL">signed letter from your Prefect</font> expressing the urgency of your situation, I, Driko, the leader of the Vuku Tribe have nothing to discuss with you anymore.
