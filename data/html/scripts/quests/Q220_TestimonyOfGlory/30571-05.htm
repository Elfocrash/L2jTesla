Ah! At last we have recovered the <font color="LEVEL">Scepter of Tantos</font> which was stolen from the ancestors' tombs by those filthy grave robbers! The betrayers of Ragna were trying to summon the spirit of Tantos and harm the Lord! Thanks to you, their wicked plan was foiled!<br>
I shall put the Scepter of Tantos with the other scepters of flame that you have recovered! Now take this ceremonial box which holds the scepters and go to meet <font color="LEVEL">Lord Kakai</font>! He will praise your achievement and contribution and grant you the Mark of Glory!
