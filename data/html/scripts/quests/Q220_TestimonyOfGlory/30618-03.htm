<html><body>Tunath Chief Harak:<br>
We have been waiting for hundreds of years for the return of our King. We knew that one day the Humans would be vanquished. I have waited all of my life to return the scepter of flame which I inherited from my father. When I heard that the messenger of the Monarch had come to Gludio, I risked my life crossing the sea to meet you. Through all the fierce attacks of the lizard tribe, we have been waiting for you -- the messenger of the Monarch.<br>
Take this scepter to the king.
