<html><body>Prefect Vokian:<br>
Very well! Then I, Prefect Vokian, will give you an order! Defeat these evil creatures and return with proof of your deed.<br>
There is <font color="LEVEL">Manashen</font>, described as "a stone statue that crosses the sky" near the Ivory Tower of Oren. Smash that thing to pieces and bring back 10 shards.<br>
There are the <font color="LEVEL">Tyrants</font> who terrorize the Gludio wasteland. Defeat them and bring back at least 10 claws!<br>
Finally, defeat <font color="LEVEL">Guardian Basilisk</font>, the so-called "guardian of sterility" in Death Pass and bring back at least 10 of its fangs.<br>
If you are a true heir to the power and pride of the Orcs, you should pass this test easily! Go complete your task and return; I will wait for you here.<br>
Before you depart, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for something special that may help you on your journey.
