<html><body>Vuku Chief Driko:<br>
I am facing a big problem which could be a matter of life and death for my tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom. Per the agreement between us, I shall give you our tribal scepter when you kill the <font color="LEVEL">drones</font> among the <font color="LEVEL">swamp stakatos</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">30 of their husks</font>.
