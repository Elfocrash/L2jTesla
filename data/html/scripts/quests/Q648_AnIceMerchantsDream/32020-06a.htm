You may get a Black Ice Crystal by processing a Silver Ice Crystal using the tools on the shelf. It won't be easy, as it is a job usually done only by professional craftsmen. If you succeed in creating the Black Ice Crystal, I'll pay you very well for it. Be careful, however, because failure won't pay you a thing.<br>
If you were to stay around for a while we might could work out a deal...
