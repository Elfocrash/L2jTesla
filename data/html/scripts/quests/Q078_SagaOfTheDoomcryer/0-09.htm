<html><body>Grand Seer Rahorakti:<br>
 If you can commune with even one dead soul, you will transcend the power of a Warcryer!<br>
 Now your power will exceed that of the one who can communicate with 99 dead souls! You will communicate with all dead souls at once, and your cries will ring out every place you go!<br>
You'll become like a lamp, shining brightly, guiding everyone along the path as the winter approaches! The ancestors and dead souls will commune with all Orcs through you! Your roars shall pierce the most severe winter, oh Doom Cryer!</body></html>
