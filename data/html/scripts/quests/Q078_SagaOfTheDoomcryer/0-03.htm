<html><body>Grand Seer Rahorakti:<br>
Tarkai Zu Dudamara! A wandering Warcryer and a seer of webs! He rides on a web, and you can actually trace his path by looking at the webs he leaves behind!<br>
He visited me a while back and told me to prepare for the eternal winter.<br>
Unless I misunderstood him, you're the one he was talking about... You'll weave the coat that'll last all winter! Take this book that Tarkai left here, and proudly walk the path of a Warcryer!<br>
Follow the trail first blazed by Tarkai! The Dudamara totem spirit will show you the way.<br>
