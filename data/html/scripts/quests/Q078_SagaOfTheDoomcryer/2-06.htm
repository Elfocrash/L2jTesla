Take this stone that the god of fire himself entrusted to me! It contains many powers... The greatest of all is the power to recover forgotten memories from the era of heroes...<br>
The memories are stored in Tablets of Vision, distributed throughout the world... You'll find the first just south of the Tower of Insolence.<br>
When you've communed with all the stone tablets, you'll know whether or not you'll endure the coming winter. Now, go!</body></html>
