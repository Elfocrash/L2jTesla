<html><body>Grand Seer Rahorakti:<br>
 If you can commune with even one dead soul, you will transcend the power of a Warcryer!<br>
 Now your power will exceed even that of the one who can communicate with 99 dead souls! You'll actually communicate with all dead souls at once, and your cries will ring out every place you go!<br>
But I fear that you lack the strength to get us through the winter. Develop your mind and body to endure the rigors of winter. (Only a character at level 76 or above may transfer class. Be careful. You cannot change occupation if you stop Quest!)</body></html>
