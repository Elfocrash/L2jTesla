<html><body>Railroad Worker Obi:<br>
This area has gone to hell lately! The security was never that great, but once there were merchants and warehouses, security guards and adventurers... But that was a long time ago...<br>
Now they're all gone! All that's left is this old, worn-out railroad station and the Bandits who rob anyone foolish enough to come here!<br>
How would you like a job?<br>
