You have brought me 100 fangs as promised! Thank you! Now our queen can make the talismans to protect the birds of the forest. I hope that the day will soon come when songbirds will sing from every tree branch.<br>
Please don't leave yet! We pixies always repay any help we receive. There! Take this. I found it in the woods a few days ago. Your kind seems to like this kind of sparkling stone, right? This is a very precious stone, isn't it? Am I wrong?
