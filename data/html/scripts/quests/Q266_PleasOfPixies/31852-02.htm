A few days ago, the king of the birds came to my race and asked for help. The <font color="LEVEL">red keltirs</font> are stealing eggs from the nests of aquatic birds, hidden in the grass, and eating them. Also, the <font color="LEVEL">gray wolves</font> are eating the young pheasants. So, they asked us to kill those greedy animals.<br>
It is true that the keltir and the wolf only act on their inbred natural instinct, but we must stop them from preying on the birds so heavily if we are to recover the balance of the forest!<br>
Our wise queen has found the perfect solution for protecting the birds. We can protect bird nests and homes by placing talismans that emit a power keltirs and wolves fear. This will prevent them from approaching the birds. But we are having difficulties collecting the necessary materials to create this talisman. Do you think you could help us?<br>
