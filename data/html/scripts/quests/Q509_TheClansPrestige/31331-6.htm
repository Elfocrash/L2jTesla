<html><body>Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
I believe that leaders are expected to supply two things most of all.<br>
One is a compelling vision or sense of purpose for the group. And you bear a special responsibility to articulate that vision, and in a very compelling fashion.<br>
And the second thing is to provide clear decisions. Doing that requires data collection and consultation, but ultimately leaders must set a direction.<br>
Anyway you're welcome whenever you change your mind and decide we'd need to discuss the reputation of your clan again.<br>
Farewell, and may we meet again in happier times.<br>
