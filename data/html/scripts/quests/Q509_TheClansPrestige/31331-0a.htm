<html><body>Grand Magister Valdis:<br>
Hearing this, you may think that the place has the bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area. But due to its proximity to the border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain a somewhat tense atmosphere. The two types of atmosphere were always co-mingling and created a unique balance for years.<br>
But an increasing number of powerful monsters started to be a major menace to this balance. Of course we, the honorable citizens of Rune can not get our hands bloody nor pose a risk to our personal belongings by sending the city guards into the task of making these daemons to retreat.<br>
However, if we find some private army brave enough to join forces with us, there's one thing we can surely grant as a payment given our position and influence, and <font color="LEVEL">Reputation</font> it is.<br>
I can see you're not the kind of people with the vein of a leader, so we have nothing to talk about.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a leader of a clan level 6 and above.)
