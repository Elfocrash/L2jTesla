The ancestors have told me that the word is <font color="LEVEL">tepu</font>. And they have also revealed that the monument stands beneath a tree at the end of the <font color="LEVEL">northeast</font> part of the Lost Nest.<br>
This was all I heard before my strength was exhausted and my spirit fled back to my body.<br>
But I fear that you will face obstacles on this journey that I cannot foresee.
