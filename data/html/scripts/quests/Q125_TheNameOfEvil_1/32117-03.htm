Wallamai means a bowl filled with blood. Once the Lost Nest was a sacred place for the Elroki. Young warriors proved themselves by traveling there and completing a ceremonial rite-of-passage. But then the dinosaurs of the Lost Nest became so vicious that few of our young men returned, and those who did were half-past dead with the fear of what they had seen. In our day, only one warrior has successfully penetrated the Lost Nest and returned: Mushika. He brought out a metal fragment that he claimed was a sacred relic of our ancient past.<br>
But he was the last Elrokian to enter the Lost Nest, and it cost him dearly. I did not expect that the chief would entrust our fate to an outsider like yourself, but perhaps he sees more than I do of this matter. So, outsider of fate, are you ready to leave for our Wallamai?<br>
