<html><body>Ulu Kaimu:<br>
My brother Balu Kaimu stands under a tree near the road if you travel <font color="LEVEL">south</font> from here. Communicate with him in the same way you have with me.<br>
Awaken him with the word <font color="LEVEL">toon</font>, which Shilen first said to him when she gave him life. He will share his wisdom with you.
