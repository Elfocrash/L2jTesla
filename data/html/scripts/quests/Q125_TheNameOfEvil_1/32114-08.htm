<html><body>Mushika:<br>
I have spent my life trying to win back the Lost Nest for my people. Many believe it is a fool's errand, and that I have neglected the present for the sake of the past. But in my heart I know that this is my sacred duty.<br>
The relative comfort of our life on these Primeval Plains is a sweet poison to my people, sapping our will and causing us to forget our glorious past. We must complete the duty entrusted to us by the goddess; if we fail in this trust, we deserve to be erased from the memory of the world!<br>
As I see the signs -- secret feuds, mysterious diseases, violent children -- I see our end approaching. And I believe these occurrences are connected to some change in the Lost Nest itself. Have you met the shaman Karakawei?<br>
