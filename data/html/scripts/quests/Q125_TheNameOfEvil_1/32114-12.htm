Shilen, you have answered our heartfelt prayers! Blessed are you!<br>
Oh, outsider of fate, our tribe already owes you our thanks.<br>
You have risked your life to bring us this epitaph, and Asamah and I will not rest until we have deciphered it. Thanks to you, I know we will finally prove to our Elrokian brothers and sisters that we are the descendants of the same glorious race who once governed the dinosaurs of the Lost Nest.<br>
Asamah, Karakawei and I have pledged a blood-oath that we will never cease our efforts until we Elrokians return to the Lost Nest and are reborn as the great Elroki tribe we once were. As leader of the Elroki tribe, I thank you for all your efforts on our behalf. I am sorry we have to wealth with which to thank you, but I will shortly display my gratitude as best I can.
