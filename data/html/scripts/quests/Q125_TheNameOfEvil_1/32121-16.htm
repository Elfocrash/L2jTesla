May I see it more closely? (Place the relic near the Pillar.) This is indeed proof that you are the long-awaited outsider fated to save this island. Long ago, Shilen foretold that when the ancient evil of this island woke again from its slumber, fate would send an outsider, armed with Gazkh, to save the Elrokian people and restore them to their rightful home.<br>
Shilen instructed the we Kaimus share with him the wisdom he needs. You are the outsider whom fate has chosen! I now obey my mother Shilen's command -- here is written wisdom concerning Gazkh. Return to the Elrokian village and give this to its leader. He too has an important role to play in averting this coming doom and will aid you in your quest.
