<html><body>Seer Livina:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! Now that the goblins have moved here to the Immortal Plateau, that dirty race has damaged the legacy of our ancestors and stained our holy ground for hundreds of years.<br>
However, now we Orcs will commence an unmerciful punishment on the goblins! It is not something for one of a different race, like yourself, to meddle in, so be careful not to become involved in the fight for no purpose!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by an Orcish character.)
