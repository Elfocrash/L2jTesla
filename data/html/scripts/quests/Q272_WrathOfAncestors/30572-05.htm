<html><body>Seer Livina:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! May glory be upon the Orcs! With this, the blood of fifty goblin grave diggers has wet the ground and their heads have been sacrificed to our ancestors to pacify their wrath.<br>
Young Orc, you have done very well! You fought for our pride and you deserve a reward! Take this money and enjoy it as much as you want! Having fun and resting are also ways to prepare for the next battle!<br>
Now, I must prepare the sacrificial ceremony for the spirits of our ancestors. After you've rested enough, come visit me. This battle shall continue until we clear those dirty goblins out of our land!
