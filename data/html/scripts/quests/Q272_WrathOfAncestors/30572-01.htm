<html><body>Seer Livina:<br>
Tejakar Oroka! Since the goblins moved here while we were at war against the Elves, they have been damaging the legacy of our ancestors and have been staining our sacred grounds for hundreds of years.<br>
Just a few days ago, reckless <font color="LEVEL">Goblin grave robbers</font> dug up our great Urutu graves and dishonored us! Because of this incident, the spirits of our ancestors were furious and appear in our dreams every night, shouting for revenge in blood.<br>
When the next full moon rises, we plan to cut the head of those unholy grave robbers and calm the fury of the ancestral spirits by performing a sacrificial rite. When the time comes, I will order many young brothers to punish those goblins, so be prepared!<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 5 and above.)
