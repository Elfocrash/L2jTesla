<html><body>Gatekeeper Tamil:<br>
Giran is very far from here. Here's a magic scroll that allows you to use the gate of time and space.<br>
It's a scroll called the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape to Giran Castle Town</font>. This is valuable, you can use it only <font color="LEVEL">once</font>! Use it wisely.<br>
I will put it in your quest item window. I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Traveler</font> as well. When you wish to return to Immortal Plateau, hometown of the Orcs, take this mark and go visit <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci</font> at his boutique shop. He'll help you.<br>
May the glory of Pa'agrio be with you!
