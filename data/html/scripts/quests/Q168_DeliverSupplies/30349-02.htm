<html><body>Sentry Jenna:<br>
Have you ever met Tetrarch Kaitar? They say that he has been blessed by the goddess with the power to predict future perils. His prophecy is sometimes ambiguous and hard to understand, but it has never been false. So everyone listens to the predictions of Kaitar. Sometimes I get chills up my spine as I see him cast his predictions. I can feel the forces reaching out even to me.<br>
Just a few days ago, he said the Dark Forest may be attacked by a foreign invader. Who the invader is and how powerful the enemy may be are still unclear, but we sentry sisters are thoroughly preparing ourselves, as the village may fall under attack.<br>
As a preventive measure I've ordered new adamantite weapons from <font color="LEVEL">Master Harant</font>, but haven't gotten them yet. I cannot leave my post because I am on duty, but could you go and see Harant for me and bring back the goods that I have ordered?<br>
