Ah, so Jenna sent you. The new weapons for the sentries have been finished. This is all thanks to Blacksmith Karrod, who has worked day and night to finish them. These are prime swords crafted of adamantite. But I have not finished the task of casting magic on these weapons. Well, it's not anything elaborate, just magic that makes the sword a little bit lighter and the blade a little bit sharper.<br>
I need more time to finish my task ... But since Jenna seems so anxious, go and deliver these three swords that are finished. And give her regards from Master Harant.
