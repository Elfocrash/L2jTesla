<html><body>Sentry Jenna:<br>
I see that you have not delivered the <font color="LEVEL">swords</font> to my sisters yet. Please deliver the weapons to Sentries Roselyn and Kristin and bring back the old bronze swords they have been using.<br>
Roselyn is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And Kristin is on duty at the village entrance opposite Roselyn.
