Haven't you been able to meet Master Harant yet? He is in the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctum of Shilen</font> in the village. It is the building where the four Tetrarchs and many Masters reside. Follow the cave behind me and go to the center of the village square. Then take the stairs on the right. The great building at the top of the stairs is the Sanctum of Shilen.
