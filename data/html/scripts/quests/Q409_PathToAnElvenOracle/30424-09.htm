Pu... punished? Like a witch... Will I be burnt at the stake?<br>
I, I'm sorry... They are all lies! Miracle and sacred flame of prophecy... they are all made up! I just wanted to care for my brother...<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Perrin</font> made me do it! He brought fake patients and we prayed for treatment and acted like a miracle had happened. I knew it was wrong, but I needed money to cure my sick brother. Perrin said I could earn big money if I did what he said.<br>
Recently some strange lizardmen tried to take me away... I'm so scared... I don't know what to do...<br>
