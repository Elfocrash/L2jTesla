We must go... together?<br>
No! I don't want to go! I must take care of my little brother. Miracles and sacred flame of prophecy... they were all lies!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Perrin</font> made me do it... He brought fake patients and acted like we prayed for treatment... And acted like a miracle had happened. I knew it was wrong, but... I need money to cure my sick brother. Perrin said I could earn big money if only I did what he said...<br>
Then, these strange lizardmen tried to take me away... I'm so scared! I don't know what to do...<br>
