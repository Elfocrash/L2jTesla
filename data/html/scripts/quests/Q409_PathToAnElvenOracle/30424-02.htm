What was that monster? I'm afraid... I don't want to die... I don't want to abandon my brother and die!<br>
I don't want to trick people anymore! However, Perrin didn't give me the money he owes me yet.<br>
I wrote down all the work I've done until now in my <font color="LEVEL">diary.</font> I will give this to you... Please help me get the money from Perrin... I need that money to cure my brother's illness...<br>
Perrin hides around here somewhere... Please... Please help me!
