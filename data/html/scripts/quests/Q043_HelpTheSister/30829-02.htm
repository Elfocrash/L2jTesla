Oh, wonderful! You survivied!<br>
Frankly, even though I often say that I want to move away, it's hard to leave the big city! I must have adena to live in the territory right now!<br>
I was saving up a little every day, but when I returned home one day, I found that my sister had disappeared! She left a note saying that she was going out in the world to help me!<br>
I couldn't do much as her older brother, but I've heard that her name is on a list of graduates from Talking Island.<br>
I must see her, if only to give her a sword! I hate to ask you this so suddenly, but...<br>
Can you help me?<br>
