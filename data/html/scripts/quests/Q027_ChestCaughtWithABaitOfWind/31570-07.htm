I think this is the <font color="LEVEL">large blue treasure box</font> that my client lost. It seems to contain a blueprint of golem. The only blacksmith in this whole area capable of making such a thing is Shaling in this village. She told me recently that she had dropped a box containing a blueprint in the river while she was traveling. This must be it! Please take this blueprint of golem to Shaling in the Blacksmith Shop.
