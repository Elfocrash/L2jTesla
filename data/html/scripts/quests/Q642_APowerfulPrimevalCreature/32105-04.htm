Wonderful! This island is filled with perils, so the wizards and Dwarven artisans studying these dinosaurs need the help of brave adventurers to collect the materials necessary to complete their work.<br>
They asked me to recommend someone skilled enough and brave enough to handle the task. You seem a likely candidate!<br>
Go and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font> and bring back samples of their biological tissue.<br>
For your information, one <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Egg</font> and 150 dinosaur biological tissues can be processed as one set of samples.<br>
You will be able to find the egg while exploring the dinosaurs' habitat. But be very careful! When the egg is disturbed, <font color="LEVEL">the nearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it. We do not require as many eggs as biological tissue, so assess the situation carefully and do what you think is best</font>.<br>
Good luck, my friend!
