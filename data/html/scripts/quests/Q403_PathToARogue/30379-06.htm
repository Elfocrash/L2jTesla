<html><body>Captain Bezique:<br>
The thieves are no doubt some of the remaining troops of Ol Mahum. The foreign Ol Mahum troops that were employed by Gracia during the war a few years ago are still lingering in the campgrounds beyond the mountains northeast of the village.<br>
I will tell you one more thing. There is someone who can help you catch the thieves. She lives in this village and her name is <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font> ... To tell you the truth, she was once a swashbuckling robber who made the corrupt aristocrats of the kingdom shiver in their sleep. Furthermore, she was a famous Mercenary who found many treasures in various ruins.<br>
She will be able to help you catch the thieves. If you go without any notice, you may be turned down at her door, so take this letter. I once did her a favor, so she will definitely help you.
