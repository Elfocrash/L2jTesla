Oh! You've recovered all the stolen items. Thank you for your trouble. Your skills are better than I thought. I think you really have the qualities to become a good Rogue.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Red-eyed Bandits...</font> Have you ever heard of them? They are the largest group of bandits on the continent with their home in the snow-covered mountains of Oren. I can't believe those stupid thieves were related to the Red-eyed Bandits... I need to make a detailed inquiry into this. Hmm...<br>
Anyhow, I will write you a letter of Recommendation. Go to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Ramos</font> at the Fighters Guild and show him my Recommendation. Then you can change occupations to a Rogue. Well then, I wish you luck. Oh, and I almost forgot! I will give Neti back her bow and dagger for you. I have to go and thank her, anyway.
