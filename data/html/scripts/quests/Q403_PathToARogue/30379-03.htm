You are an ambitious youth. However, I think you still lack skills. I have an eye for talent, and can say this with confidence ...<br>
I say this out of concern for your welfare, so don't be too discouraged. This task is too dangerous for you. However, I will give you work if you return to me after you gain more skill.
