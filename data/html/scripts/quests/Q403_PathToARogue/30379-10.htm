By the look of that bow and dagger, I see Neti has given you a task to test your skills. In the past, Neti's skills with the bow and dagger were the finest in all Gludio. People's mouths would hang open whenever she shot an apple off a young child's head. If you want to be a Rogue, you must learn how to use your bow and dagger well.
