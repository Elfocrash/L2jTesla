I have to connect the two broken halves together, but it will be more difficult task than I thought. I'm calculating in my mind how high the temperature of the furnace must be, how many times I should hammer the blade, and other factors.<br>
By the way, have you brought back the sword handle from Roien? What do you mean, not yet? Look, if you don't have the sword handle, I can't restore this sword to its original state!
