<html><body>Grand Master Roein:<br>
Perhaps you have heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Sword of Solidarity?</font> They say it is a find blade treasured by the Elves that resided on this island long ago. Theses days, whenever I have the time I visit the libraries within Einhovant's School of Magic, to look through books and read stories related to the sword. Seeing that it is recorded not only in Human history books but also in those of Elves, it seems certain that this sword really existed...<br>
If this Sword of Solidarity really existed, wouldn't it be hidden somewhere on the island? Such a precious and magnificent blade as that would not be easily destroyed or abandoned... I plan to search the island for the sword some day. If you are interested, won't you come along?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 9 and above.)
