<html><body>Grand Master Roien:<br>
First, go and show this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Altran</font>. In the letter, I have organized information that I've discovered regarding the Sword of Solidarity during my research of Ancient Scrolls at Einhovant's School of Magic. Altran says that his ancestors created the blade and asked me to research information about the sword.<br>
You can meet Altran by going to the village forge. Thank you.
