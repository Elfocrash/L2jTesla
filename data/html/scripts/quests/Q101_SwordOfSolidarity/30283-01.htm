Ah! Roein's Letter! Thank you!<br>
So they say that the craftsman in the legend that created the 'Sword of Solidarity' was a Dwarf, like me? A sword created by my ancestors a thousand years ago ... I'm curious to see what it looks like. If only we could find the missing broken blades, I would be able to return the Sword of Solidarity to its original state... I hope you can recover the blade fragments. Is that too difficult of a task to ask?<br>
