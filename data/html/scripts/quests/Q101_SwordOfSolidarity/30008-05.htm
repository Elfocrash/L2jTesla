You've found all the pieces of the broken blade?! What wonderful news! Now Altran can restore the Sword of Solidarity. But in order to do so, he's going to need the sword handle.<br>
Now, take this to <font color="LEVEL">Altran</font>. Please tell him that it is given to him in thanks for all the help he has given us with the reconstruction of the training hall.
