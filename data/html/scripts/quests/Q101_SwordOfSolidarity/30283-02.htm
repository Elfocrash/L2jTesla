<html><body>Blacksmith Altran:<br>
According to Roien's research, the blade was broken into two parts, and they are probably somewhere in the Elven Ruins. They may even be in the dirty hands of the <font color="LEVEL">Orcs that live in the ruins</font>... But those Orcs don't know how to deal with Steel, and probably don't have the skills to reassemble the pieces. They're probably using it to skin rabbits or something.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font> and search for the <font color="LEVEL">two pieces of the broken blade</font>. I'm sure you don't know the way, so I will write down the directions on this note. Be careful! They say that the ruins are not only full of Orcs, but other savage beasts as well.
