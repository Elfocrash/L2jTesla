<html><body>Researcher Lorain:<br>
The last time I ventured into the deepest part of the dungeon I encountered a monster they call the catherok. His attack caused my body to start tingling all over, followed by complete paralysis! Luckily, my colleagues saved me from certain death! When I gathered my wits, I noticed that an ancient relic had been activated. It gave off an amazing light... At that moment, it came to me! The sting of the catherok contained a power source that actually activated ancient relics!<br>
Take this relic and entice a catherok to attack. It will become activated. When it reaches its brightest, bring it back to me. Heed my words, you must never confront the catherok alone.
