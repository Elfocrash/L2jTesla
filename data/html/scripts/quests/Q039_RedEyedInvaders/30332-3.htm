I realize you just completed a difficult task, but we still need your help!<br>
We must discover the <font color="LEVEL">connection between Maille Lizardmen and the Araneids</font>. They've been fighting alongside the lizardmen! This is unheard of!<br>
Return to the <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen Barracks</font> and investigate this unholy alliance! You should be able to find out more if you kill <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen Scouts and Guards</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Giant Araneids</font>.
