<html><body>Guard Babenco:<br>
I just received a report that a large army of savage <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen</font> is gathering in the western section of Gludio Castle Town. They're not satisfied staying on the plains.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis</font> is recruiting militiamen in Gludio, and we need help, but this is too dangerous for beginners.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 20 and above.)
