<html><body>Master Virgil:<br>
You have brought the Coffin of Eternal Rest with your name inscribed within it. I will send this to the Priests of the Temple of Shilen. This completes your trial.<br>
A Knight's destiny is always to face death on the battlefield! We do not know when it will come, but it is an end we cannot escape. By entrusting the Coffin of Eternal Rest made by your own hands to the Celebrants of your funeral, you are accepting death as your fate and laying down all fear. This is what the ritual of the red coffin is for.<br>
Palus Knights do not fear death, and so they do not hesitate or stand back. They are the strongest Knights, that have already seen the darkness of the abyss and know not fear nor hesitation. Since you passed both trials, you have the ability to enter the glorious ranks. This <font color="LEVEL">Gaze of Abyss</font> is the token you have earned. If you take this to <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font> of our guild, he will change your occupation. He is the one right over there.
