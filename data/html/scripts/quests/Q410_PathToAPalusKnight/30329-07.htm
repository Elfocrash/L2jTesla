How does it happen that you have not departed yet? Is fear or hesitation keeping you here? If that is so, I will have to reconsider your qualifications for becoming a Palus Knight.<br>
Hurry on to the Neutral Zone and kill the lycanthropes and bring <font color="LEVEL">thirteen of their skulls</font>. Only then can you fulfill the custom.
