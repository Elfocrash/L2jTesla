Now you are the true owner of this <font color="LEVEL">Coffin of Eternal Rest</font>. The last part of the trial is to carry this coffin and go back to the one who first gave you the trial. Go to <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil in Gludio Castle Town</font> and give him your coffin.<br>
I hope you will safely complete your trial and be reborn as a Knight of the deep lake. May the protection of Shilen be with you.
