You must have exactly <font color="LEVEL">13</font> skulls to complete the ritual. Thirteen is a holy number to we Dark Elves that follow Shilen, for it symbolizes death and rebirth.<br>
Go back to the Neutral Zone and strike down the lycanthropes ... Come back when you have 13 skulls. Only then can the ritual be completed.
