Thank you. Thirteen skulls brought from dealing with the enemy of our race ... They are the result of death brought about from your own hands. Knights of other races embellish their actions and duties by saying that they are "guarding justice" or "protecting the common people." However, the knights of the dark do not forget the essence of knighthood through hiding behind fancy words or moral obligations. A knight is one that brings death. The victory he achieves with his sword means his opponent's death.<br>
No matter what the goal or motive, all combat between knights ends in death. Just because you shout "honor" or "justice" doesn't change what it means to kill. Death is death. You have stolen your opponent's opportunity to live.<br>
Do not forget the fact that you are the "one who brings death."<br>
