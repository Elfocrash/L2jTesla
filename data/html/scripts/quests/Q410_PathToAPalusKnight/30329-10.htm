You need your own coffin to perform the second trial, the <font color="LEVEL">Ritual of the Red Coffin</font>. Yes, I'm speaking of the coffin you use to bury an elf when he dies. According to the funeral customs of the Dark Elves, we need a traditional coffin made from the carapace of a beast. You must make this yourself.<br>
You should ask <font color="LEVEL">Abyssal Celebrant Kalinta</font> how to make a coffin. You can meet her if you go to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elven Guild of the village of Gludin</font>. You must take this letter with you.
