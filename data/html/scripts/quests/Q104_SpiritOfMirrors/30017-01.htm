<html><body>Grand Magister Gallint:<br>
I don't know why, but the magic defense field that I erected around the school of magic disappeared a few days ago. I have restored most of the shields, but I am worried that the spirits that were kept within the school for research have escaped to the outside.<br>
If some spirits have escaped, I may have to ask you to go and capture them ...<br>
