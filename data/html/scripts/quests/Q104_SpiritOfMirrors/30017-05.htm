So you have captured all the escaped spirits! Thank you! In the meantime, I have reconstructed all of the magic barriers around the school, and the spirits will not escape again.<br>
I will give you this as a reward for your work. It may not look like much, but it is a helpful item which brings out the inner magic potential of the user. As Einhovant has always said, true power comes from within.
