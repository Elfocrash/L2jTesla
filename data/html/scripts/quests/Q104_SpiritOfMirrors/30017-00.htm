<html><body>Grand Magister Gallint:<br>
Young traveler of an alien race, how did you chance to journey to this remote island? I'm sure the Human world must seem fascinating to your eyes. I do wish I could speak with you longer, but unfortunately I have pressing matters to attend to, and cannot spend my time in idle conversation.<br>
When we both have more time, won't you tell me about your homeland?<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a Human character.)
