A few days ago, while patrolling the <font color="LEVEL">northern parts of the island</font>, I encountered a werewolf <font color="LEVEL">near a farm</font>. I drew my bow and chased after him, but all of a sudden, his body started to waver, and he turned into a great toad! Do you think there are some werewolves that know how to perform strange magic?
