Very well! First, take this insignia, which signifies that you are performing the Trial of the Guildsman. Many blacksmiths and senior warehouse keepers will assist you when they see it.<br>
The trial itself is very straightforward. <font color="LEVEL">You must make 7 Journeyman Rings</font>. Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity, however. The process of making the rings themselves is a critical test of a Dwarf's skill and wit.<br>
Why 7 rings, you ask? Well, it's a tradition reaching back to the beginning of the Kingdom and the formation of the guilds themselves. Six of the rings go to the elders of the 6 guilds, while the last is reserved for the King who will return.<br>
To obtain the ring design blueprint, visit <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Altran on Talking Island</font>. I will write a letter of introduction for you, free of charge. When you finish creating all 7 rings, return here.<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade it for something special from the village gatekeeper. I hope it will help you on your journey. What are youn waiting for?<br>
