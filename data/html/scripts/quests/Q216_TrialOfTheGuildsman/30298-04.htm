You think you can get the Amber Beads by yourself...? Oho! Indeed you are a Scavenger! I can tell you where to look.<br>
There are giant ants living in the <font color="LEVEL">Wastelands</font>, in the southern part of Gludio. They mine the Amber Beads, which are plentiful there. To get the beads you must kill the <font color="LEVEL">work ants</font> not the ant soldiers, understand? You will be able to collect faster by casting <font color="LEVEL">Spoil</font>.<br>
We will need about 20 beads to make Journeyman Deco Beads. However I can also use them in my work, I would be very grateful if you brought back <font color="LEVEL">70</font>. I will give your order top priority. Quite a deal, huh?
