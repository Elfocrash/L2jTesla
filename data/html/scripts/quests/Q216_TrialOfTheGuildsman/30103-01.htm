I have been in charge of the promotion test of the Dwarf union members for the last 10 years. Among all Dwarf apprentices, only those who pass this test are accepted as full members of Dwarven society. This may not be clear to you since you are not a Dwarf, but within our society there is a complex hierarchy and ranking system.<br>
