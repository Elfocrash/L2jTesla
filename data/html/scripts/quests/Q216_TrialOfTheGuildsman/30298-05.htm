You think you can get the Amber Beads by yourself? Oho! You are not even a Scavenger! Oh, well, if you want to try I can tell you where to find them.<br>
There are giant ants living in the <font color="LEVEL">Wastelands</font>, in the southern part of Gludio. They mine the Amber Beads which are plentiful in that place. To get the beads you must kill the <font color="LEVEL">work ants</font> instead of ant soldiers, got it?<br>
We need about 20 beads to make Journeyman Decoration Beads. However, I also use them in my work, it would be nice if you brought back <font color="LEVEL">70</font>. I will give your order top priority. So how about it, a good deal, no?<br>
Oh yes! And take this <font color="LEVEL">recipe</font>. It will help you.<br>
