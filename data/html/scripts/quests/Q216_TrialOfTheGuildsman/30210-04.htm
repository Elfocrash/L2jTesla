<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Norman:<br>
Well, if you say so... At the moment I have something you can help me with.<br>
I am having many difficulties these days because of the gangs nearby town. Especially the Ol Mahum thieves, called Cat's Eye... I wonder why the guards won't protect us from them... Anyway, I am thinking of changing all the locks of the warehouse... The locks which I have ordered have already arrived, but the keys aren't here yet.<br>
I ordered them from <font color="LEVEL">Duning of Hunters Village</font>. Will you go and fetch the keys for me? Here, this is the receipt.
