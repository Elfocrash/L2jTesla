Good! You must first take this badge. It is a mark that lets others know that you are in the midst of taking the Trial of the Guildsman. Many Blacksmiths and Warehouse Chiefs will help you when they see your badge.<br>
The content of the test is quite simple. It consists of <font color="LEVEL">making seven Journeyman Rings</font>. It may sound simple but the process of making the ring itself will challenge your ability and wit.<br>
Why seven rings? Actually... You shall offer one to the yet-to-come King of the Dwarves, and the rest to the six Elders of the guilds. It is a long held tradition that has been kept since the founding of the kingdom and the forming of the guilds.<br>
If you wish to learn to make the rings, go and see <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Altran of Talking Island</font>. Take him this letter. Don't worry, I expect nothing in return. When you complete the seven rings come and see me again. Good luck!<br>
