How long will you be an apprentice? Don't you have any ambition? I hope you are not under the impression that you have reached a comfortable level. Shouldn't you work harder and challenge the <font color="LEVEL">Trial of the Guildsman</font>? You won't be a true member of Dwarven society until you pass that test. If you are really satisfied being a nobody for the rest of your life, I won't mention it again.<br>
(Quest for Scavengers or Artisans, level 35 and above.)
