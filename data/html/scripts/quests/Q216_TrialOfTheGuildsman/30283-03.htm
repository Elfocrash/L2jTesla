Back in the old days I had to memorize hundreds of formulas. Now they all have recipes! What will they think of next?<br>

[Production of Journeyman Ring]<br>
[Materials] 1 Journeyman Gem, 1 Journeyman Deco Bead, 1 Steel, 10 Varnish, 10 Grade D Crystals<br>
[Result] 1 Journeyman Ring<br>
Steel and Varnish are commonly used and easily found. Journeyman Gems and Journeyman Deco Beads are harder to find, however.<br>
