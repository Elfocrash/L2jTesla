Yes, that's a good boy. Now I shall give you the list of materials that you must find.<br>
First, we need some <font color="LEVEL">Gray Bone Powder</font> to use as an abrasive. You can get it from undead monsters such as <font color="LEVEL">ghouls</font> or <font color="LEVEL">strains</font>. You will find plenty in the Execution Ground of Dion.<br>
I also need a <font color="LEVEL">Granite Whetstone</font>, which is for polishing the surface of the jewel... You must find pieces of the <font color="LEVEL">granite golems</font> that can be found in the Execution Ground or in the Wasteland!<br>
Other things that we need are the <font color="LEVEL">Red Pigment</font>, which you can get from the <font color="LEVEL">dead seeker</font> bat on the Execution Ground. Last, we need some <font color="LEVEL">Braided Yarn</font>, which you can get by hunting the <font color="LEVEL">silenos</font> in the Plains of Dion...<br>
Can you remember everything? I will need <font color="LEVEL">70 each of all the above things</font>. You need 7 Journeyman Gems, right? It will take 10 materials each per 1 jewel. Good luck then!
