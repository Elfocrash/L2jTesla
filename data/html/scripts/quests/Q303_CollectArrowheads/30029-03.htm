<html><body>Master Minia:<br>
There are many orcs on Talking Island, but the Tunath orcs are at the <font color="LEVEL">Elven Ruins</font>. You will be able to find arrowheads of Tunath orc marksmans. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Kenyos.<br>
They are not merely for my private purposes, I plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.
