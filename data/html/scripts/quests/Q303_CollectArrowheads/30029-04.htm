Please gather ten arrowheads used by the Tunath orc marksmans and bring them to me. I am not collecting them simply for my private purposes, but plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition.<br>
Tunath orcs are in the Elven Ruins. If you don't know how to go there, ask Guard Kenyos.
