Hmm... something urgent?<br>
Ah, a message from our lord. Another meeting? If he wants to hold a meeting every ten days, what are people living in remote island such as myself supposed to do... it takes a few days just to travel back and forth by ship... plus I'm not interested in sitting in a meeting with the empty-headed nobles.<br>
Well, my apologies to our lord, but I am just going to skip this meeting. I'm sure he will understand if I send a reply explaining the reason. Anyway, thanks for the letter. I guess the guards are busy, asking someone like you to do such a task and all. Oh here, take this. It's not much, but it's in appreciation for coming all the way here to seek me out.<br>
Take a look around, while you're here. I don't know if you are interested in history, but there are many historic relics of ancient Talking Island in this area. This memorial tower right here was built a thousand years ago. Also, the remains of the ancient Elven magic school lie just to the west.<br>
