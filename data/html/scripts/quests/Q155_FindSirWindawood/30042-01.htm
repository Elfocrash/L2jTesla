You might know this already, but Talking Island is part of Gludio's lands. Currently, the person officially in charge of administration and order on the island is Sir Collin Windawood. The lord himself appointed Sir Windawood governor of this island. Now the lord has called for an official meeting. Not that it's any concern of ordinary folk like us -- it's a meeting only for aristocrats who have royal titles.<br>
The problem is, a <font color="LEVEL">message</font> has arrived for Sir Windawood to attend the meeting, but I haven't been able to deliver it, as he hasn't been seen for the last few days. He is a great and honorable man, but it worries me that he has no interest in government. Sometimes, he'll take a walk into the forest and it may be days before he returns. Last time, he spent a week at the Marius farm, on the northern shores of the island. An odd person indeed...<br>
Anyway, in order for him to reach the mainland in time for the meeting, someone must deliver this official summons to Sir Windawood. I wonder where he is... how 'bout it, if you're not too busy... do you think you could help me?<br>
