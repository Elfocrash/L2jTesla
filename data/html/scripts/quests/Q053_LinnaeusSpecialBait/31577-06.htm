You've obtained all the crimson drake's hearts. Please accept this <font color="LEVEL">bait of flame</font>. You'll find it quite different than baits containing the other elements. You won't catch any fish with it, but you're more likely to discover a sunken Treasure Chest! You won't always land your catch with this bait.<br>
This bait is mostly useless unless your fishing level is exectly 20. If it's not, you should consider giving it to someone else. Remember, bring anything you recover to me unopened!
