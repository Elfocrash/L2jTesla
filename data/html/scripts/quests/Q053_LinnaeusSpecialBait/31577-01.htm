<html><body>Fishing Guild Member Linnaeus:<br>
Theese days, many nobles enjoy fishing. We fishermen like to take our time while fishing, but the nobles prefer to quickly catch things other than fish.<br>
They're quite particular about who is allowed to use the special bait, but I don't think they'd have a problem with my giving it to a fine soldier like you! Of course, I can't legally sell it to you, but if you bring me the ingredients I need, I'll make it for you for free! Don't be surprised if you pull in a treasure box when you start using this bait! It uses the power of the elements to retrieve sunken treasure! Will you bring me the materials I need?<br>
