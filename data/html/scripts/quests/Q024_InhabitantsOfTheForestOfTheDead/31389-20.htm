So, you haven't met the maid of our lord yet? Remember, she only appears at night. Naturally, things get pretty scary around here after dark... You should really be careful!<br>
But I'm sure you can handle it!<br>
Go to the bookshelf in the southwest part of the forest, the maid of the lord will be there. Meet her there at night!
