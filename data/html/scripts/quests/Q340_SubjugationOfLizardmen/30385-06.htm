Ah, you've recovered all of the guild's Cargo Boxes! Good job! I will return them to the Aden Trade Guild immediately. We really appreciate your hard work.<br>
However, despite the efforts of noble mercenaries like yourself, the lizardmen continue their despicable actions. The day before yesterday Langk lizardmen attacked and killed pilgrims from the temple of Einhasad! The temple has asked the Guards to recover the remains of the pilgrims. Would you care to join us on this mission?<br>
