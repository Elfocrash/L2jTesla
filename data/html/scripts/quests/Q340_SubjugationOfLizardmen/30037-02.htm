<html><body>High Priestess Levian:<br>
From all accounts it seems that the lizardmen worship Bifrons as a god. I would not be surprised to discover that he was being controlled by an even higher being.<br>
I sense a great evil on the <font color="LEVEL">south shore of Gludio</font>. You will not be able to deal with this menace alone, you must bring your trusted comrades with you.<br>
You must kill the evil spirit and find a weird looking chest. Inside this chest you will find the <font color="LEVEL">mark of darkness</font>. Bring it to me. Then, together, with the power of the Goddess, we will destroy that blasphemous object.
