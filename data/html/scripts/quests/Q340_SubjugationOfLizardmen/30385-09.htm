First, please accept this token of our appreciation for the work you've done so far...<br>
The task is the same as before. You must kill <font color="LEVEL">felim lizardmen</font> at the Fellmere Harvest Grounds between the Ruins of Agony and Windy Hill and recover <font color="LEVEL">30 Cargo Boxes belonging to the trade guild</font>. Thank you for once again helping our cause.
