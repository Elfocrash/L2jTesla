<html><body>Guard Weisz:<br>
Do you plan to follow the northern road on your voyage to Oren? If so, you must beware of the lizardmen. They are becoming more brazen with their atrocities.<br>Those filthy reptiles! It wasn't enough to burn farms and slaughter livestock. Now they are looting in broad daylight! Something must be done about this outrage!<br>
Unfortunately, our guards have their hands full with the Turek orcs and the Ol Mahums... We are going to have to rely on mercenaries to save us from these lizardmen. If you know any skilled ones, please send them to me!<br>
