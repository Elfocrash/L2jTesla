<html><body>Priest Adonius:<br>
Please recover the <font color="LEVEL">crucifix</font> and <font color="LEVEL">rosary</font> that belonged to Priestess Agnes. This is essential if we are to give her a proper funeral.<br>
You will find her remains on the south shore of Gludio. You should leave for there immediately! May the light of Einhasad guide your path...
