Were you sent by the guards? Oh, thank heaven you've arrived! We are desperately in need of your help!<br>
First, I suppose I should tell you of the horrible event of three days ago. Priestess Agnes was leading a group of the faithful of our congregation back home from a pilgrimage to the Grand Temple in Giran when they were attacked by the dreaded Langk lizardmen. They were all slaughtered mercilessly, in the most gruesome fashion!<br>Now I can think of nothing but recovering the remains of our faithful and giving them a proper burial. We must at least recover the relics left by Agnes.<br>
