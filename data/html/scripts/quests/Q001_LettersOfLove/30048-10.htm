Ah, is this the potion? Thank you. I have finished the poem to recite to Roxxy, and bought roses too. Now that I have the potion that Baulro has made, all that is left is for me to do is to go and talk to Roxxy. For some reason, I have a feeling that things will all go well. This is all thanks to your help.<br>
Take this as a token of gratitude. Though it's not much... Please do not decline, just take my gift.
