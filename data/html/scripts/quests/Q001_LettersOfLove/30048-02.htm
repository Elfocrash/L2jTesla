Do you know what is more dangerous than a knight's sword or a magician's spell? It is love. It comes unexpectedly and swallows a man's entire soul, and never releases it. This thing called love is what makes me so happy and agonized these days. I have no motivation or appetite... I'm so disappointed in myself.<br>
