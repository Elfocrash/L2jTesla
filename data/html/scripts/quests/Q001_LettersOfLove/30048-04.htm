What, you don't know her? How could you not know her? The fairest maiden in all of Talking Island... Plus, she is highly trained in magic and has studied at the Ivory Tower in Oren. She is also a member of the Gatekeepers Guild which manages the magic portals that connect the various villages together.<br>
Such an accomplished lady... Would she even give me a chance? I often think of going and confessing my love to her, but... I just don't have the courage to do it. I mean, what if she refuses? It would kill me. It's been a week since I wrote a letter confessing my affections for her, but it still sits in my pocket...<br>
Could you do me a favor? My letter... Would you deliver it to Roxxy?<br>
