Oh my, a letter for me...? From Darin... Yes, of course I know him. I thought he had feelings for me and, actually, I like him too. I think he is a very fine person. Of course, there is that trifling matter of him being so timid...<br>
I've been waiting for him to come and talk to me, but I guess he couldn't go through with it after all, and had to ask you. Ha... well, that's okay, I don't mind.<br>
Here, please give Darin my <font color="LEVEL">handkerchief</font>. And please deliver my message to our shy Darin that I will accept his affections with all my heart.
