Huh? Darin's receipt? Ah, the magic potion. Darin is a fine lad, but he is too shy for his own good. It's good to hear that he's finally made up his mind to go and talk to Roxxy.<br>
Please deliver this to Darin now. Actually... don't tell him, but the contents of this bottle is plain water from the well in front of the temple. The talk about magic potions that have been handed down from generation to generation... well, those are stories that I made up to encourage Darin. This potion is no different from plain old water. I would appreciate it if you don't tell and just give this <font color="LEVEL">magic potion</font> to Darin.
