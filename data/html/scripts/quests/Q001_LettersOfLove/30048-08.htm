Roxxy's kerchief! She likes me! It seems like a dream... Thank you! This is all thanks to you!<br>
Before the sun sets today... I must ask her permission to court her. I need to go and buy flowers, get dressed... But there's no time. I should hurry. Oh, and I'm really sorry, but would you do me one more favor?<br>
A while ago, I had a talk with Baulro from the temple regarding Roxxy, and he promised that he would create a magic potion for me that makes the user more eloquent, saying that it would be helpful when courting a woman. Something about being able to capture the person's heart through witty talk? It was a bit expensive, but I bought it thinking that I would need it to talk with Roxxy. Please take this receipt to <font color="LEVEL">Baulro</font> and tell him my situation, and he will give you the potion.
