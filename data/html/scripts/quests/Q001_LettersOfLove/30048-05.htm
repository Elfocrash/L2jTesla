Ah, so you do know her. It's hard to find such a beauty as Roxxy, isn't it? A woman like her... Would she even give me a chance? I often think of going and confessing my love to her, but I just don't have the courage to do it. I mean, what if she refuses? It would kill me. It's been a week since I wrote a letter confessing my affections for her, but it still sits in my pocket, without being delivered...<br>
Could you do me a favor? My letter... Would you deliver it to Roxxy?<br>
