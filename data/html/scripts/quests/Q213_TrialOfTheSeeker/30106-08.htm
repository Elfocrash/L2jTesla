This is the report of Terry, the Hawkeye! Pardon me a moment while I peruse this . . . Hmmm . . . the children of Shilen! Oh my -- it seems as though they have finally begun to act on a large scale . . .<br>
Well, enough of that for now. My thanks for a job well done. We'll handle it from here. Terry was impressed with your skills, and I see no reason to doubt him. As a token of our thanks, please accept this Mark of Seeker from our guild.<br>
Your efforts may have made the difference in our ability to weather the coming storm. Thank you! I wish you every good fortune as you depart.
