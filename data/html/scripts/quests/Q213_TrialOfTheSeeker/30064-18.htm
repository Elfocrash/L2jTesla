I think you are ready for the next task. Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar is somewhat worrisome, but according to Marina's research, the contamination is limited to only a few creatures. You must destroy those hosts.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Marsh Stakato Drones</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Breka Orc Overlords</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Ant Warrior Captains</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Leto Lizardman Warriors</font> are the monsters you must hunt. Of course, these creatures all have <font color="LEVEL">aggressive tendencies</font>. Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br>
Do you know where they are?<br>
