So, there are 4 Dark Bezoars altogether! I am so glad to see you alive. Master Dufner, he still has the sense for recognizing talented people. Thanks to you, I could solve the problem in a short hour.<br>
Oh, I guess you must also be curious about the results? I secretly found out that there was a group of people called the 'children of Shilen' behind this case. Did you ever hear of the name? They are the followers of Shilen who are looking forward to the resurrection of their Goddess. They are working secretly so few people know about them. The Royal palace is busy enough dealing with the war, and they have no time to take measures against them.<br>
This is becoming a serious matter now that it turned out to be their organization that is related to this case. This is not something that we can just overlook. I shall have to report this. This is a report which contains the details on this case. Take it to Master Dufner. He will take care of the rest. You have done a good job, thank you.
