You must heed my every word. We each have our own tasks to do. While I am away you must investigate the mutations one at a time.<br>
They are <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Captain</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Warlord</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Ant Captain</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Turak Bugbear Warrior</font>... That's it. I expect that they each have a bezoar planted in their bodies.<br>
The problem is that these creatures are all very aggressive, even more so than normal.<br>
But I think you can handle it... Do you need any more information?<br>
