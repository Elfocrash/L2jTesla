<html><body>Master Dufner:<br>
Good! I think it'd be easier to investigate if you slayed a few of the mutant magical creatures first. But... once the investigation reaches a certain point, you'll run into problems that you can't handle by yourself.<br>
I'll introduce you to someone that may be of help to you. His name is Hawkeye, he acts the part of a common master, but he was once a great Assassin. He was nicknamed 'Hawkeye' for never failing to achieve his mission or eliminate his target. Take this letter to him and request his aid.<br>
I have written the identity of this person in the letter, so keep that in mind. Don't tell anyone about this, your utmost discretion is needed, and be careful.
