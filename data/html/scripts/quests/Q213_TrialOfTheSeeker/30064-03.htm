We'll begin with the one living closest to this town. That would be <font color="LEVEL">Neer Ghoul Berserker</font>. At the east Execution Grounds you will find many neer crawlers. Among them you will find <font color="LEVEL">Neer Ghoul Berserker</font>. Catch him, take anything you find on him and come back to me right away.
