<html><body>Master Dufner:<br>
Our kingdom is being threatened by mutants! I am in need of guild members skilled in concealment and scouting. I think you will be very useful once you gain a bit more experience.<br>
If you successfully complete this task the guild will acknowledge your skills and you will find it easier to change to a higher level occupation. Please come back to me when you have more experience. I will be waiting for you.<br>
(This quest may only be undertaken by a character of level 35 and above.)
