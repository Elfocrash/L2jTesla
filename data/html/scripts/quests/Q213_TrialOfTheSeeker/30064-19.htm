Marsh Stakato Drones can be found in the Cruma Marshlands north of Dion. It is a dangerous monster, so take care. You must try to avoid attacking them from a close distance when they are in groups. You must lure them away before fighting.<br>
You have already seen many Breka Orc Overlords, yes? They are located in Breka's Stronghold. The same goes for them. When they are in a group, do not attack them.<br>
The Ant Warrior Captains can be found below the Wastelands in the Ant's Nest. I presume you have already seen them when you were hunting the Ant Captain? He is very fierce.<br>
The Leto Lizardmen Warrior is the one you must be most wary of. He is the most dangerous of all, and may be too strong for you even now.<br>
We don't have much time. I must ask you to take the risk, and do your best, though it is a tough task. If you have friends that you can trust, it would be good to take them with you. Leto Lizardmen Warriors can be found on the Plains of the Lizardmen.<br>
Good luck to you, then!
