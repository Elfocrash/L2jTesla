<html><body>Master Terry:<br>
I hope your investigation is going well? Time is short so you must hurry. Do you remember your task? You must hunt <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Captains</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Warlords</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Ant Captain</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Turak Bugbear Warriors</font>... Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.<br>
I am not sure if it is due to the bezoars, but they are behaving very <font color="LEVEL">aggressively</font>. Please, be careful.<br>
