1, 2, 3... 10! Yes you have brought all 10 of them. Ha ha...This takes me one step further in my plan... Ha ha ha!<br>
Did I say that out loud? Never mind, I was just daydreaming...<br>
You have proven yourself and I shall give you the information you seek. While you were hunting I was studying the bezoar.<br>
It is also known as 'Abyss Runestone'. It is often associated with Shilen, the Goddess of Abyss. How do I know this? When you flash a particular wavelength of light, the emanation of the refraction-dispersion creates a typical distribution of Ruper's curve. If you magnify the pattern, apply the Magnus' constant, compare it by Bernu's analysis, you will find a shape similar to Shilen's pattern between the 8th and the 9th diagram... What does this mean? It means that this bezoar is related to Shilen. I could tell you more but you wouldn't understand.<br>
However, there is one problem.<br>
