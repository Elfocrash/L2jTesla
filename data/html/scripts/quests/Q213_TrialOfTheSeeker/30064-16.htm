I am sure you are aware that creatures who have an Abyss Runestone inside them have exceptional intelligence... The matter would not be so dangerous if that's all there was to it, but these creatures are extremely hostile towards Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, Dwarves and Humans. Do you understand why those creatures have become so aggressive?... They are very clever so they will surely influence their fellow creatures... Imagine the carnage if they incite the others!<br>
I am convinced that this has something to do with the Goddess Shilen. The dark powers of Shilen are the origin of the Dark Bezoars... It is said the Goddess of Darkness and the original Goddess of Water traveled east, where she created many different magical creatures. It is quite alarming how many years have passed and only now are Shilen's powers are being detected in the monsters.<br>
The most frightening part we have learned from this experiment is that the Dark Bezoar is contagious. Moreover, according to Marina's experiment, these Bezoars are not natural, but manufactured.<br>
The road ahead will be rough. We will both be tested to our limits. Certainly you wouldn't abandon the investigation at this point?<br>
