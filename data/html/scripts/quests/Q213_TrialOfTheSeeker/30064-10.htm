<html><body>Master Terry:<br>
Take this letter and the box containing the bezoars to <font color="LEVEL">Viktor of the Hunter's Village</font>.<br>
He is an expert in such matters. Back when I was called Hawkeye, he was known as the clairvoyant. He is quite well known for being an excellent source of information, even to this day. I am sure he'll be able to find something out from the bezoars. He owns a shop at the moment... A very unlikely occupation for him...<br>
Anyway, take this letter to him. Tell him that Hawkeye sent you, he will talk to you. If he feigns a lack of understanding, say <font color="LEVEL">'Altebar Karryos'</font> loudly. That is my real name. By the way, he never does anything for free... He will probably ask you for something. In that case, use your own judgement.<br>
I am sure you shall do your best!
