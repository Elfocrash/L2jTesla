Very well! This is just my opinion, but I suspect that it will be easier for you to first find and kill some of those evil mutants and then investigate. Once your investigation reaches a certain point, howver, I'm reasonably certain that you will encounter a situation you cannot handle by yourself.<br>
Let me introduce you to someone who might be able to assist you. He is currently in hiding, masquerading like any other master, but in his day he was a feared assassin known as "Hawkeye." His targets could never escape his ruthless aim. Take this letter to him and ask him for help.<br>
I have included some additional information about him for your enlightenment. Please be careful that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.<br>
Also, take this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>. You can trade this <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font> for something special from the village gatekeeper, and it will help you a lot on your journey.
