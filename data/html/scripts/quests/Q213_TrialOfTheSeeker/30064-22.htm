How is the hunting going? Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar is something to worry about; however, according to Marina's research, the contamination seems to be limited to only a few creatures. I want you to be in charge of getting rid of those hosts.<br>
Marsh Stakato Drones, Breka Orc Overlords, Ant Warrior Captains, and Leto Lizardman Warriors are on the list. Of course, these creatures all have tendencies to be aggressive. Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.<br>
Do you know where you can find them?<br>
