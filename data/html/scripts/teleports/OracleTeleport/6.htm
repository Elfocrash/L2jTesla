<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
At one time, these catacombs and necropolises existed in another dimension, before the seals that bound them were broken. The moment the seal was broken, it shattered into thousands of pieces and scattered throughout the area. The pieces of the seal are called <font color="LEVEL">dimension fragments</font>. If you want one, you'll need to enter into another Contract with me.<br>
Based on our investigation, others are currently collecting dimension fragments. They are the <font color="LEVEL">guardians of ancient magic</font>. I'll tell you more when we sign the Contract.
