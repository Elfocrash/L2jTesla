<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
As you may already know, first I'll send you to a safe waiting place. Speak with the <font color="LEVEL">Rift Post</font> there, they'll let you inside.<br>
They're classified depending on where their responsibilities lie.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The level 30 force is managed by Recruits, level 40 by Privates, level 50 by Officers, level 60 by Generals, level 70 by Commanders and higher-force Heroes</font>. Take heed and visit the manager most suitable for you. Good luck!
