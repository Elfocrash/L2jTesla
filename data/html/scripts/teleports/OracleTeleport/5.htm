<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
First, I'll send you to the waiting room, a safe space we created. While there, speak with the <font color="LEVEL">Keeper of the Gap</font>. He'll allow you to enter the dimension gap.<br>
However, they are classified based on the place that they manage.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Level 30's are managed by Recruits, Level 40's by Privates, Level 50's by Officers, Level 60's by Captains, Level 70's by Commanders, and the higher levels by Heroes</font>. Don't forget this, and visit a keeper of the gap appropriate for your level. Well, good luck to you.
