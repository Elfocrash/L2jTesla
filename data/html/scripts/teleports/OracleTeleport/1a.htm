<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
Dimension gaps are unstable places, where time and space are not what they seem. You may find yourself thrown out of one before you even realize you're there! If you expect to stay for any period of time there, you'll need to sign a Contract which allows us to constantly monitor your situation. Otherwise, you could be lost in the gap for eternity, never to see the light of this world again!<br>
Oh, I see that you have too many prior commitments to enter into a Contract with us at this time.
