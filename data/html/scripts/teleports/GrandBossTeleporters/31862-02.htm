<html><body> Angelic Vortex:<br>
In ancient times a mighty emperor named Baium became so enamored of his own power that he began to fancy himself a god. He conscripted all of his people to build an awesome tower that reached almost to heaven.<br>
The gods were not amused. They struck him down, cursed him with immortality and imprisoned him in his own tower for eternity! A statue of the foolish emperor stands there to this day.<br>
Occasionally, the old emperor himself is woken up by those who seek his power. Unfortunately, when Baium is disturbed, so are the angels who guard him.<br>
Although the angels are certainly no friend of Baium, they regard Humans with equal disdain. <font color="LEVEL">Ultimate success against Baium depends upon the defeat of the guardian angels.</font> This is all I can tell you. Good luck!
