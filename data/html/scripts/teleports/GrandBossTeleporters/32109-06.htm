You have the heart to fight Sailren, of that there can be no doubt. But one of your fellow doesn't meet the experience requirements to kill such a beast. If I let you enter with your party in, Sailren will certainly kill him. If you want to teleport within, leave your friend in a safer place.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">Listen to the entry requirements and battle method.</a>
