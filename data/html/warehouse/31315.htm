<html><body>Warehouse Freightman Daisy:<br>
Ah, my cute little brothers, Hugin, Durin and Lunin... It's quite rare for an entire family to be posted to the same guild, let alone the same warehouse! We wouldn't be together if it wasn't for Uncle Donal!<br>
Family is the most important thing, don't you think? You should never take them for granted. In fact, you should send a gift to your family via our freight service! We deliver all items promptly!<br>
