Come in, come in! Put those heavy things down...<br>
You can trust this warehouse... It's run by the Dwarven Bank Association! You can claim your items at any of our warehouses!<br>
Some Dwarven warehouses were looted during the numerous ancients wars... You probably haven't heard about all of that...<br>
