In the age of great disaster, our goddess was filled with sadness at seeing so many deaths. They say her tears formed Lake Iris.<br>
A long time ago, just once, I saw the lake nymphs dancing on the ripples as if they were gliding. Now all the lake nymphs have left, but sometimes if you take a walk around Lake Iris you can hear the echoes of their singing.
