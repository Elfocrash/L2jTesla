I sometimes talk with my friend Reikin about what the <font color="LEVEL">water dragon Fafurion</font> would look like. It s truly hard to imagine that Fafurion lives in Innadril Lake, just east from here. If that dragon ever ventured upon our village, complete annihilation would only be a matter of time, don t you think?<br>
