<html><body>Sentinel Trionell:<br>
The Neutral Zone begins right after crossing this bridge. After the war between the Elves and Dark Elves, the area was designated as a Neutral Zone to prevent conflict. It has played its role as a buffer zone for a long time.<br>
Since neither side steps into this zone, the forest is thick, and all sorts of strange life forms that cannot be seen elsewhere gather here.
