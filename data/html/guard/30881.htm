<html><body>Border Guard Sanders:<br>
Hello there Sir. What is the purpose of your visit here? Ah, my name is Sanders. I am one of the border guards. This place used to be the only roadway that connected our Aden Kingdom and Elmore. But as you can see, it is currently blocked.<br>
Although we do not believe that Elmore has enough strength left to invade us again, due to various political issues that still need to be worked out, this place will not be completely opened any time soon.<br>
