We're not talking about the birds that actually live in the bushes. These Magpie Brothers are not so cute. Originally they were of the Dwarven guild that specializes in searching ruins and collecting relics but they were going around the graves of the ancient Dwarven kings and stealing stuff. And they were expelled from our tribe when this was discovered. But they simply changed themselves into a new grave robbing guild and now they make no distinction of race when digging up the places in which the past royalty are buried. Of course, various graves at the National Cemetary have also been vandalized by them... <br>
I don't understand why the ghosts don't deal with those creatures. Really!<br>
