<html><body>Guard Tavillian:<br>
Ah, yes, of course! Tavillian! I misspoke! Shops are in the basement of the tower. Here, as you can see, the first floor is the lobby. On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floor you will find the guilds of Humans, Elves and Dark Elves respectively.<br>
The gatekeeper will assist your passage between the floors. You may not use the stairs.<br>
