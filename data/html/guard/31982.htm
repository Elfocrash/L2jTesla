You may not enter the village if you possess contraband or your identification is not in order. I'll need to check your papers and belongings. Thanks for your cooperation.<br>
Is this your first time here? This is a dangerous place for adventurers, my friend! Captain Vishotsky keeps the peace here, but the forest out there is a different matter! All sorts of vicious monsters lurk just outside the walls of this village! Even the mighty Vishotsky can't kill all of them!<br>
