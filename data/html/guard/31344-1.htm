The<font color="LEVEL"> Swamp of Screams</font>? It's a very dangerous place.<br>
The stakatos are ferocious and the water in the swamp is poisonous. I hear you become addicted when you get near the water, you don't even have to drink it!<br>
The Golden Ram Mercenary Force was hired to wipe them out. Best to use the experts, you'd need a miracle to survive there!<br>
