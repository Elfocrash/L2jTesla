Yep, blood-sucking vampires, buddy! Have you heard about the one that looks like a beautiful woman? She seduces people and then sucks their blood! They die if they're lucky! The really unlucky ones turn into vampires! I've been carrying around a holy symbol and cloves of garlic since I heard about that one! I've got a wife and children to think about!<br>
