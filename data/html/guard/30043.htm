<html><body>Guard Johnstone:<br>
Since I was young, I have idolized Mystics and wanted to study at <font color="LEVEL">Einhovant's School of Wizardry,</font> but unfortunately the teachers there told me I had no magical talent.<br>
Now I realize that my physical strength is where my true gifts lie. In the end, I've become a guard, and I don't regret it.<br>
