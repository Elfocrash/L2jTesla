There are all sorts of rumors about the great Wizard Hardin, but hardly anyone knows his true identity. Some say the demon Beleth is actually Hardin, others say that Hardin is the one who cursed the Dark Elves, and yet others say he helped King Rauhel unify the kingdom of Aden. I don't know what is true, but anyway, from the stories he seems to be the most powerful of all Wizards, don't you think?
