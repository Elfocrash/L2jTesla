I suppose our village looks peculiar to outsiders. It's divided into three sections.<br>
The castle has an upper and lower level. The upper level consists of a<font color="LEVEL"> clan hall and the Temple of Einhasad</font>. The lower level features the<font color="LEVEL"> Library of Sages</font> and a<font color="LEVEL"> Combat Training Camp</font>.<br>
Just in front of us is our latest development! It's our commercial district, with<font color="LEVEL"> Dwarven stores, blacksmith shops and warehouses</font>.<br>
