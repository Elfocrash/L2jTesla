In the past it was known as the Forest of Doppelgangers. Monsters there masqueraded as known Men and attacked unwary victims... Honestly I have never seen my doppelganger. It is said the you will die instantly if you do...<br>
However I am fairly sure that these monsters existed in the past. Everyone knows that if you hear someone following you through the woods you must never look back but run away with your eyes covered...<br>
Don't worry, no reason to believe they are still around, but actually no reason to think they are extinct, either... I wonder why they would become extinct? If so, what sort of creatures might live in the Forest of Mirrors?
