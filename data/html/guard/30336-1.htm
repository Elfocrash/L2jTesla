The Ruins of Despair were originally the village of Lostern. Before the war, it was a prosperous farm village, but the Gracian army reduced it to ashes. The ghosts of the soldiers that were cruelly slaughtered while trying to protect the village still roam there, with their swords and bows, not knowing that the war is over.<br>
