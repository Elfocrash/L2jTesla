The town of Gludio is a place where you can observe various cultures, since many races gather there. It is a very good place to extend your knowledge of the Human world. However, it is filled with large and unshapely buildings, so it is stifling. It is difficult to find your way around there, so if you go, you should make sure to learn where the guild and shops are first.
