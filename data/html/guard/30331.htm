<html><body>Guard Thoma:<br>
Our captain is a bit gullible. He says we must stick to military discipline because we serve so near the lord's castle. I don't think someone as high as the lord would care about what one guard wears...<br>
What do you think? Is there any need to lecture us about what we should wear? Don't they say substance is more valuable than appearance... Of course, everybody prefers it when things look nice and neat.<br>
