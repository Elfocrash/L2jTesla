Well, OK... It's that Baium is still said to be living there. The gods confined him there with a curse making it so he can never die. And so the king went crazy after the passage of a long time... But... this might be a secret... There is a rumor that not long ago, some crazy Dark Elf woman opened the door to the tower and released Baium. To find out the facts of the situation, an investigation team was sent by the royal family and the Ivory Tower...<br>
Currently, that tower cannot be accessed by ordinary people.<br>
