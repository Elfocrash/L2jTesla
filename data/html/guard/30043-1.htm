The school is a wondrous place that teaches the basics of magic to young people born with magical talent. They say that it was built by a Wizard named Einhovant and his followers, but hardly anyone claims to have actually seen him. It makes me wonder if there really was such a person.<br>
The school is just beyond that mountain in front of me, on the shores of a small lake. It's quite a big building, so you can't miss it.
