<html><body>Guard Friggar:<br>
Hey, stranger! Stop nosing around and get over here!<br>
Ha! You don't like being talked to like that, do you? Well, when I was defeating those thieves in Dion with my bare hands, you were still in diapers! So what if you're older than me? You look much younger!<br>
Enough of this foolishness! You're an adventurer, aren't you? Have you been to the Lair of Antharas? Hmm... I've been so close to that dragon I could feel the hot breath from his nose! Ah, yes, those were the days! If only I hadn't injured my legs... I wouldn't have to be a guard!<br>
