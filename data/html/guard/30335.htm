Have you been to the southern parts of Gludio by any chance? My cousin used to work as a mercenary soldier, but he exaggerated so much, I couldn't really believe much that he told me.<br>
What was it that he said? It was something about a large cave in the Wastelands of southern Gludio and giant ants that ate people. Can you believe such a tall tale? Hah! That rascal, he would have been a greater success if he'd become a storyteller.<br>
