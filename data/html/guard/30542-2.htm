Really? So I guess you're not from around here? All right then, I'll explain it to you. Hmm, well, there was a monster called Earth Worm Trasken deep in the eastern mountains. They say that it was a devil created by Shilen, but I wouldn't know about that.<br>
Anyway, the Dwarves were busy mining for mithril, and they accidentally reached the nest of the Earth Worm. Well, it was a big disaster. We thought we Dwarves would be wiped out. But all of a sudden, this Dwarf called Lucien shows up. He was so great! He had a one-on-one fight with the Earth Worm. Hoo, must have been quite a sight. Anyway, Lucien's been the hero of Dwarves ever since. He's no longer living, of course, but there are statues of him all over. Ahh ... I want to be like Lucien ...
