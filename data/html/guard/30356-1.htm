<html><body>Sentry Altima:<br>
This is the vast forest where our people have been living from ancient times, although now it is dispoiled by barbarous goblins and orcs. One day we Sentries will drive all of the filthy intruders out of the forest.,br>
The Dark Forest begins at the edge of the village. If you continue on the path to the souththwest, you will arrive in the region of Gludio, where Humans live. You can ask Sentry Marion or Kayleen at the entrance of the cave for more details. Both are well informed on the geography of the forest.
