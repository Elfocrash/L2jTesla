This forest may seem peaceful at first glance, but terrible enemies lurk within. For hundreds of years, our kingdom was under attack by the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, the fungus from the Sea of Spores, and the giant spiders from the Wasteland of Gludio.<br>
When you travel in the forest, you must not forget for one moment the threats that hide behind the lovely scenery.<br>
