The temple serves Shilen, mother of the abyss. It is not only a sacred temple where rituals are held for the goddess, but also a place where young Dark Elves learn discipline, basic combat skills and magic.<br>
Within the deepest parts of the temple lies Patriarch Mitraell. To get to the temple, go up to the surface and then just a bit to the left.
