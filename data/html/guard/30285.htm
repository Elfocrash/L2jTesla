<html><body>Sentinel Gartrandell:<br>
May the blessing of the starlight fall upon you. My name is Gartrandell, one of the sentinels who guard the forest and the Mother Tree Glade. I left the forefront because I was injured in the war with the Dark Elves, and now I guard the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctum of Eva.</font><br>
The Sanctum of Eva is home to splendid Elven cultural relics, so I am proud of my job. I am also pleased that I can stay a little closer to my sweetheart.<br>
