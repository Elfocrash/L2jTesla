<html><body>Sentry Knight Rayla:<br>
Sentries are guardians who protect the Dark Forest from invaders. We also escort the Tetrarchs and carry out the laws to punish those who have broken the commandments.<br>
They say the Elves of light also have guards called Sentinels. But please, do not compare us with the weak Elves.
