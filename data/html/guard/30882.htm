<html><body>Border Guard Oskar Blackbird:<br>
Are you a traveler? This is not the kind of place you want to be visiting as a tourist... Sorry, but I'm going to need to check your baggage.<br>
... Hmm, there's nothing here that's particularly suspicious. If you follow the road to the south a short way, you'll come to Aden Castle and Aden Castle Town. I recommend that you stay there tonight. You can't cross the border now. In the past, only people with a transit certificate could go back and forth but as far as I know, the issuance of such certificates has been suspended...<br>
