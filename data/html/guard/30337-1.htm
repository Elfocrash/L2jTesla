If you cross this bridge and follow the road, you can reach the Elven Forest. I have never been there myself, but according to the Elves that come here it is a very beautiful place.<br>
Until just recently, the Elves had erected a magic force around their forest so that no one could enter, but now anyone can enter the forest. If you get to go there, please come back someday and tell me all about it.
