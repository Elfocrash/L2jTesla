<html><body>Sentinel Knight Alberius:<br>
May the divine protection of Eva be with you. I am Sentinel Knight Smallberry, commander of the <font color="LEVEL">Sentinels</font> that guard the holy forest and the Mother Tree Glade.<br>
The building you see behind me is the <font color="LEVEL">Sanctuary of Eva</font> -- the elders that guide the Elves of Light dwell here. It is also a place for young Elves to train in swordsmanship and magic.<br>
