Is that a fact? OK then, wait a moment. First I need to record your belongings and appearance. And what's your name?<br>
....?<br>
.... What kind of a name is that? Alright, fine. If you're really planning to go to the Shilen Holy Place, then there are some things I need to notify you about.<br>
You might already know about this but that place is where the depraved god Shilen gave birth to six dragons and then changed them into death goddesses. According to the legend, the army of light defeated the depraved god but was not able to kill the goddesses that control the world of darkness and so they are sealed in that place. Therefore, there are a lot of religious researchers, clergymen and fanatics gathered there...<br>
And there are strange ones that want to kill not just the Dark Elves that serve Shilen but also those that serve the god of light, as well as other gods, which they regard as being cults. The crazy ones that fight saying they will release the seal of Shilen have plenty to do... And there are many watchers sent by the religious bodies in order to stop all those blasphemous ones. These watchers are in utter dissolutionment because of the depravity of this age... Therefore, I'm entreating you that if you go there, please avoid any actions which could have any chance of being misunderstood. I mean, regardless of whether they are fanatics of Shilen or watchers of the seal... OK?<br>
