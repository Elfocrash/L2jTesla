Have you visited the dark forest east of the village? It's known as the<font color="LEVEL"> Forest of the Dead</font>. Once, it was a beautiful place, where deer grazed and stately oaks and wildflowers flourished! I remember picking wild strawberries with my older sister there when I was young. Then, one day, it was all gone... It still seems like a horrible dream!<br>
