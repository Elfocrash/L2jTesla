<html><body>Captain Gilbert:<br>
Nice to meet you, young friend. I am Captain Gilbert. Our guards maintain the peace in the village and work day and night to protect the residents from ferocious beasts or orcs, just like the<font color="LEVEL"> lighthouse</font> works constantly to protect ships from the rocks.<br>
If you are planning to leave the village, ask the guards about getting around on the island. We wouldn't want you to suffer misfortune, lost in a forest full of orcs and wolves.<br>
