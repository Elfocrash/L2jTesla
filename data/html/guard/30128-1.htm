<html><body>Guard Atanas:<br>
The blue dragon Fafurion is almost as strong as the green dragon Antharas, which is supposed to be horrible. Usually, it stays in the water -- I suppose that means it's somewhere on the bottom of Lake Innadril. When I think that two dragons are so near our village ... well, it makes it hard to live a worry-free life, don't you think?
