<html><body>Guard Mouen:<br>
Welcome to the Town of Oren, young traveler. I am Mouen who works for the Lord, guarding the town.<br>
Because the Town of Oren is close to our Aden Kingdom's rivals, Elmore, we are on guard thoroughly compared to other towns. This may cause travellers like you trouble, but please understand the circumstances.<br>
In fact, the people here are more like the people of Elmore. Maybe borders don't really matter for people who cut wood for their living. I can even name 10 people I know in Elmore right away, ha ha!<br>
See that dashing castle on the northern hill, that is Castle Oren. Every time I look at that castle I pray to God that the people of Oren will never live in sorrow and wish that people of Elmore will feel the power of the castle.<br>
