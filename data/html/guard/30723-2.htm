It is said that long ago a meteorite fell to earth right where the Ivory Tower stands today. The tower was built there to utilize the great magical power left over from that collision.<br>
Because of the power of this place, monsters have become something of a problem.<br>
Recently they have been dropping <font color="LEVEL">High-level Spellbooks</font> occasionally. Until now the knowledge of these books has been quite rare.<br>
Would you care to look around the Tower?<br>
