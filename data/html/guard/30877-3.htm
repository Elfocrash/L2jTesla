No, it's nothing special. It's just the useless chatter of crazy fanatics. It has been said that, a long time ago, when Shilen caused a war against Einhasad and lost, for some reason, the gods didn't kill Shilen but rather sealed her into the location that we are speaking of now...<br>
The book called the Scriptures of the Seal lists seven methods of releasing the seal of Shilen. And this is not just the seven ghost stories that are spoken of by children in school...<br>
Ah, if the depraved god is resurrected, the people living in the land will all die so do you really think that the sealing would have been done so carelessly? Obviously, this is just the useless talk of a crazy person. And if it is so easy to resurrect, the depraved goddess would have already resurrected in the distant past... Do you think that lady would still be sleeping like this if she had any choice? Am I right?<br>
