<html><body>Border Patrol Trent:<br>
This is a checkpoint of Aden s border patrol. Of course we are not the only border guards. Along the border line with Elmore, a large number of military forces are stationed. Still, comparing with the time immediately after the war, their number has decreased greatly.<br>
Since the war, I have been serving in the military& It is much better now than during the war because now I don t have to worry about putting my life in jeopardy& <br>
