The Sanctum of Eva is where young Elves come to learn swordsmanship and magic. Masters Cobendell and Ellenia teach Fighters how to use the sword and the bow. Sorcerer Esrandell and my sweetheart, Greenis, who is also a sorceress, teach the Mystics. Hierarch Asterios advises on changes of profession.<br>
It is because of their efforts that the knowledge and experience collected by our ancestors for thousands of years are passed on to the next generation.
