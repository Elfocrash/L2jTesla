It is said that in Aden Kingdom, people worship Einhasad as the goddess of healing and peace. However, to us, she's the goddess of war and justice. Her statue in the temple says it all...<br>
No matter how much you love peace, if you're not firm against evil, peace will be elusive. Don't you agree? The goddess of myth also used physical force to achieve justice and peace. We believe that we should punish evil by any means necessary.<br>
The faith of Einhasad has a long tradition in our kingdom. We have many legends and myths regarding the goddess and her disciples. Especially in the Rune region, many ancient stories are told regarding the<font color="LEVEL"> Valley of Saints</font> and the<font color="LEVEL"> Monastery of Silence</font>.<br>
