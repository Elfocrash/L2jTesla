Hello, young friend. I am Alex, the militia leader of Floran Village.<br>
This is a village of poor farmers, who sought escape from the Lord's tyranny and, subsequently, does not have organized protection with proper guards. I formed the militia as I could not see the farmers fighting adequately against thieves and have other races plunder them helplessly.<br>
