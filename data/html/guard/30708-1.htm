Well, the hunters around here aren't as occupied with trapping and hunting and selling skins as hunters from other places. Of course they do those jobs, but here the hunters are stronger, wiser and more organized. They know the forests as well as the Elves.<br>
Our hunters have served as mercenaries for many Lords. These hunters also have a strong sense of freedom and independence and refuse to be dominated by anyone.
