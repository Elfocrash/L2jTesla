It is the castle where the lord of Gludio resides. Originally, it was a ruin left by the giants of ere, but wise King Cadmus ordered the castle to be built on the site to prepare against attack from Gracia.<br>
A few years ago when Gracia last attacked our kingdom, the Gludio defense guards were newly formed. This castle was the stronghold and we fought a strong and victorious battle against the invaders. We praise his majesty for his keen foresight.
