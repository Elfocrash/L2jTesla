Where are you off to? If you're going to Castle Aden just follow this path to the north. There really isn't anyone living to the east of the town. Are you going to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of Mirrors?</font><br>
After you pass the forest, you'll see one of the most beautiful places on the continent, <font color="LEVEL">Angel Falls.</font> Despite its beauty it is a dangerous place, so don't go there if you aren't prepared for a good fight.<br>
