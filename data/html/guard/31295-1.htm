No kidding! I'll tell ya, this place really lives up to its name!<br>
Do you know about the uprising in Rune? They executed the rebels here! This place has been accursed ever since! They say the ghosts here have a taste for flesh!<br>
This is the only way to Rune, but nobody will travel this way after dark! It even creeps me out during the day! I wouldn't go down there at night if I were you!<br>
