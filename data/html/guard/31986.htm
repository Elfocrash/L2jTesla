Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo? Were you born yesterday?<br>
Kofporch is only brewed in a few areas in Schuttgart Territory. The best kinds are then hauled out and left to age in either the<font color="LEVEL"> Den of Evil</font> or the<font color="LEVEL"> Crypts of Disgrace</font>. Dangerous? Sure! But believe you me, no imitation even comes close!<br>
