<html><body>Sentinel Berros:<br>
There was a time when I traveled here and there on the continent and saw many races and what the Humans call "cities" -- massive forests of buildings made by Human hands. I was astonished by the large size of the market in Giran, the splendor of Heiness the Floating City, and the overwhelming grandeur of Castle Aden. However, most Human villages are lifeless, cold places built by butchering the land.<br>
When I finished my travels and returned to the small, quiet village upon the lake in the Elven Forest, I finally realized that this was the true home for all Elves.
