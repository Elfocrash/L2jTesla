<html><body>Guard Praga:<br>
If you follow this road west, you will come to a fork in the road. If you turn to the southwest, you will pass the Abandoned Camp. Once, it was a camp for the Gracian armies, but it has been abandoned for some time and is now the camp for the ol mahums.<br>
Those nasty ol mahums were hired by Gracia as mercenaries, but they were unable to return to their country and were left here to plunder for a living. So you must be extra careful when you're traveling near there, or you may be ambushed by ol mahum looters.<br>
