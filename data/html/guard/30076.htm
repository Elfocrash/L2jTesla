<html><body>Guard Liam:<br>
If you follow the road that lies before me to the east, you can easily arrive at the <font color="LEVEL">Bazaar of Giran.</font> One thing you must remember is to be on your guard when you pass the <font color="LEVEL">Execution Grounds,</font> about halfway there. That place is crawling with evil undead.<br>
May the divine protection of Einhasad surround you.<br>
