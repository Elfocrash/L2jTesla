<html><body>Sentinel Starden:<br>
May the song of stars give you happiness. I am Starden, one of the sentinels who protect the forest, the Mother Tree Glade, and Elves of light.<br>
If my expression looks dark, then forgive me. Originally, I was a cheerful elf who enjoyed poetry and singing, but now I've lost all my former optimism since I went through the war. I had to look upon the sight of my friends being brutally killed by the Dark Elves at the <font color="LEVEL">final battle of the Underground Fortress</font> ... I try hard to forget the fear and sorrow of those times, but I still have nightmares once in a while.<br>
