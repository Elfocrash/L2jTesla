<html><body>Guard Burke:<br>
Are you stupid or what? Do you think I'd just casually say that the government had been seduced by the devil? But look around you! Isn't it obvious? How could a forest fall under the spell of a curse, with vampires and devils roaming freely about?<br>
To make matters worse, government officials stand by without taking any action! They waste time with idiotic witch hunts and purging innocent priests!<br>
Don't get me wrong! I trust our king completely! He would never falsely accuse innocent people! But, still, I'm quite sure that there are devil-worshippers among his top aides!<br>
Dammit! I've said too much! I must watch my tongue or I could lose my head! I'm done talking! Go find out something for yourself!<br>
