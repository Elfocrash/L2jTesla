Wow! I knew you were from the south, but I didn't realize how ignorant you were!<br>
The Varka are the most powerful tribe among the Silenos! During the war with Aden, our late king hired them as mercenaries. Unfortunately, after the war they settled down in this region.<br>
You have Silenos in the south too, right? Well, don't be mistaken... The Varka are a different breed all together! They are formidable beasts that are at least equal to the Ketra Orcs in ferocity. Do you know what I mean?<br>
