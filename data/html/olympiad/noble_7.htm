When the games of the Olympiad end, the points of the Noblesse who participated are calculated. If your points exceed 40, you can trade your points for Noblesse gate passes. Each Olympiad point may be exchanged for 1,000 Noblesse gate passes, up to 2000 points.<br>
Also, for a limited time only, a Hero or anyone assigned to become a Hero may receive additional Noblesse gate passes equal to 100 Olympiad points.<br>
