<font color="LEVEL">[Activate Castle Traps]</font><br>
Activates a trap inside the castle. When activated, magic fire shoots from the trap, slowing those crossing it and engulfing them in flames.<br>
These flames will consume friends as well as foes. Used with great care, this is one of the most effective security devices available.<br>
Of course, it's not cheap!<br>
