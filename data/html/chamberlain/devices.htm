<font color="LEVEL">[Manage Castle Devices]</font><br>
The following devices can be used for the protection of the castle.<br>
These devices would all be useful in the next siege, but their high cost should be carefully weighed in your decision.<br>
If you want to reinforce your device, please note that each device can be directly reinforced to the upper level without going through the lower level.<br>
