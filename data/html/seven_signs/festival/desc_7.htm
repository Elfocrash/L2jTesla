<font color="LEVEL">[ Leaving the Festival ]</font><br>
So you wish to leave the festival? Of course you can, but remember your team mates may need you. You will also forfeit any bonuses your team will recieve if they achieve the highest score at the end of the Festival period.<br>
If you are the party leader, your whole team will leave the festival. Are you sure you want to leave?<br>
