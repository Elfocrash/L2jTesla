<font color="LEVEL">[ Time Period of the Seven Signs ]</font><br>
Each Seven Signs competition lasts for two weeks and the cycle is repeated indefinitely.<br1>
The first week is a <font color="LEVEL">competition period</font> in which two groups of fighters compete for the highest score. The second week is the <font color="LEVEL">seal validation period</font>, in which the group that won the competition controls the power of the seal.<br>
Competition Period: During this period, players may join either the Lords of Dawn or the Revolutionaries of Dusk and earn points from collecting seal stones and participating in the Festival of Darkness. The competition is held for one week from Monday 6 p.m. until the following Monday at 6 p.m. After the competition is over, the total scores will be tallied and the winner will be determined.<br>
Seal Validation Period: This is the period in which the results of the previous competition are applied. The members of the winning group will receive various benefits according to the seal they control. The members of the losing group will be subject to various disadvantages. The seal validation period starts on Monday at 6 p.m. and lasts for one week until the following Monday at 6 p.m.<br1>
When the seal validation period is over, a new competition will begin. At this time all affiliations are initialized and players are free to join any team for which they qualify.<br>
