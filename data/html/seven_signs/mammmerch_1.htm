May you receive the blessings of Mammon! We of the Mammon Guild have come far to show you some exquisite items!<br>
Before you start shopping, there are a few things I should tell you. We don't accept today's currency, but instead use only <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Adena</font>. Also, if you wish to purchase an enchanted scroll, you must bring us <font color="LEVEL">Blank Scrolls</font>.<br>
