<font color="LEVEL">[ The Seven Signs and Control of the Seals ]</font><br>
All players participating in the Seven Signs must join either the Lords of Dawn or the Revolutionaries of Dusk. The players must also choose one of the three seals: the Seal of Avarice, the Seal of Gnosis, or the Seal of Strife. This choice indicates which seal the player wishes to control during the seal validation period.<br>
The selections of all the members of each group are tallied, and if that group wins the competition, they will control the seal chosen by the majority of members in their group.<br>
If a particular seal was not controlled by any group during the previous period, or if the seal was controlled by the opposing group, only when at least 35% of the winning group selects the seal will the group control the seal. If less than 35% of the members of the group select the seal, although they have won in the competition, they won't control the seal.<br>
If a group has controlled a particular seal during the previous period, and if at least 10% of the winning group select that seal, it will be controlled by the group again. However, if less than 10% of the members of the winning group select the seal, although the group has won in the competition, the group will not be able to control the seal.<br>
