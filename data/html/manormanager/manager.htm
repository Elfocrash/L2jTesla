I'm a merchant dispatched by the Lord in order to sell Seeds from the Manor and purchase Special Products.<br>
The seeds I'm selling can be sowed only in the Manor. But the Special Products can be sold in any castle. When selling to another castle, I will sell to another Manor on your behalf for a small fee.<br>
The buying and selling of seeds for Special Products begin each day at 8 pm. Prepare in advance by referring to the Manor information begins to be displayed from 4:30 am, and come back at 8 pm. If you don't hurry, items can be sold out. Huh Huh<br>
If you also have Special Products, sell them to me. The Lord will be glad.<br>
If you perhaps don't know what the Manor or Special Product is, ask me anytime -- I will explain them to you in detail.<br>
