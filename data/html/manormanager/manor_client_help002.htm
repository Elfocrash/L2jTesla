The seeds can be classified into regular type and alternative type. If you plant a regular type seed, a monster will hide an item and give you a crop of equivalent value instead.<br>
When you plant alternative type seed, you will receive a crop approximately half of the time or you will receive an item approximately half of the time.<br>
The lord established this system so that players can choose their preferred type of gameplay by selecting the type of seed to plant in a manor.<br>
There are four kinds of seed--coda, cobol, codran and coba. Availability of each type is based upon a character's level. Coda is the seed most appropriate for farmers whose levels are between level 10 and level 30, relatively low levels. Cobol is the seed most appropriate for farmers whose levels fall between level 31 and level 48. Codran is the seed most appropriate for high level farmers of level 49 and level 64. Coba is the seed most appropriate for high level farmers of level 65 or above.<br>
Obviously, different seeds grow different crops. Certain seeds work better with certain monsters. If a monster is weak, he will produce a disappointing crop. On the other hand, if he is too strong, the crop could be damaged as well.<br>
One secret of a successful crop is to pick a monster with approximately the same power as the sower. Trying to sow a seed on a non-compliant monster can have disastrous consequences.<br>
You may purchase any seed at any time, but the lord reserves the right not to purchase any crop at his discretion. You should always check to make sure that your crop is currently in demand.<br>
And... you've got to keep it a secret from the Lord... I hear other castles buy crops... as long as they can be also purchased there... If the Lord changes his mind, I'll have no other choice but to sell my crops to other castles... Please keep it a secret.<br>
