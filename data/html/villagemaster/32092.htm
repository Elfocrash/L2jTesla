<html><body>Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>
Hail! I am Alder, Warehouse Chief of the Schuttgart Territory Iron Gate Guild. What a world, eh? Makes you want to pull the covers over you head some mornings.<br>
How can decent folk like us hope to get by? Every day I hear news of rumors of war, sometimes even between kinsmen of the same tribe! It's all madness!<br>
If there's something that gets me through the day, though, it's this: the bottom line is that every tribe wants prosperity. That means engaging in economic activities.<br>
As long as that's the case, we dwarves are indispensible! No one can match our instincts for trade and moneymaking.<br>
