<html><body>Warehouse Chief Baxt:<br>
I am Warehouse Chief Baxt of the Iron Gate Guild here in Hunter Village. I'm the one in charge of transforming Scavengers into Bounty Hunters. I'm terribly busy these days dealing with all the Scavengers who come to see me. Are you here because you too wish to become a Bounty Hunter?<br>
