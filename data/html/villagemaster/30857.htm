<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Welcome to Aden Castle Town, the heart of the kingdom. It is said that this city is truly the kingdom's cultural and religious center, and that this sanctuary of life is truly the apex of faith for all who serve Einhasad...<br>
But I tell you, friend, that true holiness is found in the ordinary and the everyday. The prayer of a commoner may resonate more deeply with the mother of light than the prayer of a high priest. Is this place, then, so very different from other temples?<br>
