<html><body>Head Blacksmith Roman:<br>
During Lionel Hunter's reign, Innadril enjoyed a long and prosperous peace. Ah, but he was a great man! He single-handedly defeated that frightful Fafurion's golem army, you know. What a feat of strenght and skill? But now it seems that long season of peace is about to end. Why else would there be so many orders for new weapons? Trouble's coming... I don't mean to complain, but I really don't see the virtue of all that banging about. The order blacksmiths may get swept up in the fever, but it seems a waste of time to me.<br>
