<html><body>Grand Master Marcus:<br>
Heine is certainly a beautiful aquatic city -- perhaps the most beautiful city in all Innadril. But you must never let your guard down, despite its beauty. In this area, remember, you will also find Devil's Isle and the Garden of Eva. Ah, and Fafurion's Island as well... They say that long ago, after being wounded by young Lionel Hunter, Fafurion was filled with hate for every stone in Innadril... How can even the grand master of a warrior guild not be afraid?<br>
