<html><body>Grand Master Oltlin:<br>
You have left your home and journeyed a long way, child of Shilen. How do you feel, now that you see the great castle and the ever-changing streets that are the pride of the Humans? I see in your eyes your admiration for their workmanship, but I warn you to not to become captive to their temptations. Often a serpent's lair lies hidden beneath a beautiful bed of flowers. Soon or later, you too will come face to face with this city's hidden truth...<br>
