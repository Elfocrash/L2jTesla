<html><body>Add subclass:<br>
You aren't eligible to add a subclass at this time.<br>
To add a subclass, you must meet the following conditions:<br>
First, you must obtain <font color="LEVEL">Mimir's Elixir</font>. To find out more about this quest, speak with Magister Ladd at the Ivory Tower of Oren.<br>
There is one important thing. You must also have completed the "Fate's Whisper" quest from Maestro Reorin, who you can find in a hut east of Oren Castle Town.<br>
Secondly, <font color="LEVEL">your current occupation must be the second or third job and all of your sub classes must be at Level 75 or above.</font> For example, if your current subclasses are Temple Knight and Silver Ranger, both Temple Knight and Silver Ranger must have reached 75 if you are to add a third subclass.<br>
Thirdly, all characters are limited to <font color="LEVEL">three subclasses</font>. That is, if any character has already three subclasses, he or she cannot add a new one.
