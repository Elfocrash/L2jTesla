Welcome to the Schuttgart Branch of the Black Anvil Guild. I'm determined to make your visit to Black Anvil Guild a memoralbe experience!<br>
Just think of all the marvelous things we make here! Creation is truly the art of the gods!<br>
Who can deny the supremacy of our race? Who else could even conceive of Siege Golems or the massive weapons we make? Even the mightiest Warriors are powerless without our expertise!<br>
Let me say this again, creativity is infinitely more valuable than swords or magic. Don't you agree?<br>
