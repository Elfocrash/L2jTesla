<html><body>High Priest Gregory:<br>
Welcome! It's always a pleasure to make the acqaintance of a talented young person such as yourself during these troubled times. I am High Priest Gregory.<br>
As a newcomer to our fair city, you may not know that all Goddard is abuzz about dire news. The Varka Silenos and Ketra Orcs apparently intend to make war, and it is even said that the Fire Dragon Valakas has awakened from his long slumber... We desperately need the strength of young warriors like you in these dark days.<br>
Remember, no matter how dark the night, dawn's light always comes -- do not abandon hope!<br>
