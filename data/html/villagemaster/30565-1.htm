<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br> 
Originally, we Orcs consisted of seven powerful tribes and reigned over the entire world. But about 2,000 years ago, we engaged in a large scale war against those despicable Elves. Of course, the superiority of our race over any other was unquestionable -- which is undoubtedly why the Elves allied themselves with those shrewd and cunning humans. Their combined treachery defeated us and drove us far from our lands. Ah, but those arrogant Elves were also betrayed by the humans and driven deep into the woods. "The hand that parries can also thrust," as the saying goes.<br>
After the war, our people built a new home here on the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font>, which was once Pa'agro's sacred ground, and we have been steadily preparing to reclaim our former glory. But <font color="LEVEL">the Ragna Tribe</font>, one of the seven original tribes, betrayed the rest. Their shameful act has tainted our people's honor. It is unforgivable! They do not even deserve to be called "Orcs."<br>
