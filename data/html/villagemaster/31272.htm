This icy air is ideal for saping steel. Scorching fire and icy air; that's the recipe for good hard steel, huh! Conflict makes everything stronger, that's for sure.<br>
The same is true with life. I've found. The sorrow, strife and trouble you face makes you strong, just like pounded steel! If you don't break, of course -- not everyone has the nature to withstand life's pounding, just like not every metal can withstand the blacksmith's hammer.<br>
Life is like blacksmithing... Only trials, no matter how troublesome they are can make you strong! Of course, some people can't stand the heat!<br>
