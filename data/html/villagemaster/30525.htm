<html><body>Head Blacksmith Bronk:<br>
I am Head Blacksmith Bronk, chief craftsman of the <font color="LEVEL">Black Anvil</font> Guild. You have undoubtedly heard of our reputation, so you know of the highly-skilled Artisans and Warsmiths who have risen through our ranks, the foremost craftsmen of the age. Without the resources of the Black Anvil Guild, a Dwarf is as useless as two pennies without a purse to carry them in. You  have a bright and eager lool about you; what errand has brought you to my door?<br>
