Welcome to Heine, the city of water...or at least be as welcome as you can be in place like this. True Orcs like me can never feel at home in a city like this, with its bright buildings and stinking Elves. I feel like firecracker thrown into water!<br>
Ah, but we do what must be done... So, why have you come looking for me?<br>
