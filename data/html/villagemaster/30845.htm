Welcome! I am Warehouse Chief Klump of the Iron Gate Guild. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure. Curious about our little operation here? Giran is the focus of our craft, of course, but the river of wealth that flows to us here in Aden Castle Town is scarcely less deep. Of couse, here we focus more on decorative and artistic items.<br>
