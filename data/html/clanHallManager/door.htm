The function controls the clan hall door.<br1>
When the door open, anyone can enter -- even those who are not members of the clan. For security purposes, you should keep the door closed as much as possible.<br>
If you wish to expel non-clan members, use the &nbsp;<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_banish_foreigner banish">Expel Outsider</a>&nbsp; menu.<br><br>
