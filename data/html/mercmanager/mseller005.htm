You will receive a certificate for each mercenary you hire. Place each certificate in the location you wish to deploy a mercenary. When a battle commences, a mercenary will be summoned to a place that is in line with the location and point-of-view of the character who placed the certificate. Your mercenaries will fight with everything they have to protect your life, my Lord!<br>
Mercenaries may be re-deployed by simply moving the certificates.<br>
There is a limit to the number of mercenaries that can be deployed, and it is possible to buy more certificates than needed.<br>

Mercenaries may only be deployed inside their castle of origin and must not be placed too closely together. All Contracts are only valid for the duration of a single siege.<br>
