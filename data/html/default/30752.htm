<html><body>Wyrm Shamhai:<br>
Are you looking for me? Why? Are you going to kill me too? Unlike the other wyrms down there, I don t have any intention of attacking you& But, are you still going to try to kill me? Somebody stole the eggs of me and my fellow wyrms. We have been going to all different parts of the continent looking for our lost eggs...<br>
