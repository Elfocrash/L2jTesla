A <font color="LEVEL">no level collector</font>, eh?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you'd like to try to raise your level, give me 5 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! Meow!</font> If you lose, you can always try again!<br>
The game will help you develop the qualities you'll need as a collector. Meow! Your abilities are evaluated by the number of glittering medals you collect and your luck is tested by the number of times you win the game.<br>
You can play as long as you have glittering medals! Meow!! Would you like to give it a try?<br>
