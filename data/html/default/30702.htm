<html><body>Hunters Guild President Bernard:<br>
Welcome to the Hunters Village, young friend. As you know, our village was first formed by hunters. We have a great tradition around here, and do not stop others from hunting near our village. We hunters must all stick together, don't you think?<br>
On the other hand, there are too many young hunters today who disregard the rules... Even needlessly fighting in the village... To prevent any trouble I hope you follow these rules:<br>
Never hunt another Hunter's prey and never take what another Hunter has captured... Easy huh? I think these are the most basic rules not only Hunters but every Human being should follow. Do you agree?<br>
Whoever breaks these rules, I will kick out of the village!<br>
