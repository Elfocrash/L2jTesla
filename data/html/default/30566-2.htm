Tejakar Oroka! The Orcs have thousands of tribes! However, only seven tribes carry on the noble blood! I am going to sing their names, so listen well!<br>
The brave Hestui!<br>
The cold-hearted Atuba!<br>
The persistent Neruga!<br>
The strong-willed Urutu, the resourceful Duda-Mara!<br>
And the merciless Gandi!<br>
One more thing! There are tribes of traitors that betrayed their own kind! Their names are forgotten!<br>
