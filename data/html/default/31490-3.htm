There are rules to the<font color="LEVEL"> Rift of Dimension</font>. Where you go and what goes on inside there remains a mystery. Once you get inside using the fragment, you'll only be able to stay for<font color="LEVEL"> about 40 minutes</font> before<font color="LEVEL"> the dimension shifts</font>. Don't forget that.<br>
If you don't like where you entered, you can<font color="LEVEL"> move just once</font>.<br>
This decision must be made by<font color="LEVEL"> the party leader</font>.<br>
You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your party while there, it's too dangerous.<br>
