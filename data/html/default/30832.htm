<html><body>Hardin:<br>
Greetings. I am the Mystic known as Hardin. I am sure that my reputation precedes me. Am I as you expected?<br>
Although I am an alumnus of the Ivory Tower, I detested the elitism there. Perhaps it was because of my youth, but... Anyway, I took my opinions very seriously at that time...<br>
Let me know if you have any question. While this school is open for everyone, magic is only taught to my pupils...<br>
