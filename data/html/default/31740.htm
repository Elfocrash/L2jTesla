My name is Caradine. I am the first daughter of the Naird family that has served the Lady of the Lake for generations. The year I turned 20 I followed my mother Morigan in service to the lady. To fulfill my lady's will I've traveled all over the world.<br>
No! You're wrong! She's real! Once when I was very young I saw her with my own eyes. Rest assured, she definitely exists! I feel her in my heart and I hear her voice whispering in my ear even now...<br>
