Excuse me... Have you heard the rumor that one of the villagers has got some really pretty beads? When I heard that, I just wanted them so bad, I got green with envy. When I want something, I can only rest once I get my hands on it. You may think I'm a grabber, but I can't help myself. I'm so happy when I get what I want.<br>
