<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
There are not many of them, but Sailren is protected by its dinosaur followers. Combined with my enchantment and the power of the other statues, we are restraining Sailren and its followers from escaping. But as they begin to break free of our control, their power and magic also begins to extend beyond the Lost Nest, affecting even the Primeval Plains!<br>
If the powers of the Stone Statues are completely broken, Sailren and its followers will escape and this island and everything on it will perish.<br>
Alas, Shilen is not here to protect us! In order to re-seal that horrifying dinosaur, you must defeat its followers first, and then work as a team to defeat Sailren.
