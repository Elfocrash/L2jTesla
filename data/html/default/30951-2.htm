The dimension vortex was invented by the ancients to allow instantaneous teleportation within the tower walls.<br> 
Activation requires a dimension stone. Each floor is accessed by different colored stones. For instance, to move to the fifth floor, you need a <font color="LEVEL">Blue Dimension Stone</font>. To go to the first floor, you need a <font color="LEVEL">Green Dimension Stone</font>.<br> 
All of the dimension stones are quite rare, but especially precious are the red ones. These are favored by the Platinum tribe and their angels, and are almost impossible to obtain.<br> 
You could always take the stairs of course! The exercise might be good for your health! Or not! Heh heh!<br>
