Hmm? How strange it is for someone to speak to me. Aren't you afraid of me? Everyone avoids me, whispering that I am a leper or a pagan. They are a foolish race that is afraid or jealous if something is slightly different from themselves ...<br>
Well ...! It is rather better for me. It is comfortable not having people bother you.<br>
