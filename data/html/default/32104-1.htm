<html><body>Vervato:<br>
The corpse wasn't revived! This means that no one in your party is dead. Why did you ask me to revive a corpse without knowing that?!<br>
You have caused me to waste both my time and my energy. Fool! Next time, make sure that someone in your party is actually dead before coming to see me.
