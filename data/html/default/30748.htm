Hey, you of a race that walks on two legs. Why have you come up this tall mountain? If you're planning to kill me with that weapon of yours, please do it now. I lost all my eggs and so I am terribly heartbroken... Where could those guys that took all my eggs have gone? Might they have crossed this mountain range and gone to the Elven Village where the Mother Tree is?... Or could they have gone to that Sea of Spores which is protected by the aura created by Humans and Elves?...<br>
