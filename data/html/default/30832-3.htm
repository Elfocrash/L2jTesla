The Mystic Beleth graduated from the Ivory Tower during the time of Elmoreden. He had such an awesome power that he seemed immortal even then. He became greedy and misused his power to such a degree that he became known as a demon...<br>
But why do you want to know about him...? Do you think I know something anyone else couldn't tell you?<br>
Perhaps you think I had a relationship with Beleth?<br>
