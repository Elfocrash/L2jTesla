Dandy Gouph is a true Dwarf! I have wound my way through the world with many friends of the <font color="LEVEL">Bronze Key</font>! Still there are many strange places in the world, so let's go, friends -- Let's venture out! Wait, treasures ... Gouph is coming soon! Precious treasures are all ours! Let's venture out to the entire world! Gold and silver worth more than my life ... I am Gouph ... A Dwarf among Dwarves! If my dear lover wants, I can even pull out the teeth of a fierce dragon. Yippee! Gouph is fine!!<br>
Oh bless me -- I made another great song before I knew it ... !<br>
Oh, my! How long have you been standing there? You ... you heard, er, everything?<br>
