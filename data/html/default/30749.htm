La, la, la, la... Do you like to take baths....?<br>
Hey, am I the first drake you've seen taking a bath? Why are you looking with such interest? Your looking is making me embarassed! Whew... Next time I'm going to have to take my bath way over in Iris Lake on the other side of those mountains... Your race that walks around on two legs can't go over those mountains, but we can go anywhere. By the way, I heard there is a road that one can take to go from the western side of the mountains to here...<br>
