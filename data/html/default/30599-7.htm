Skills are not learned just once. They can be upgraded continuously through the use of SP. If you have learned the first level of Power Strike, you should gather 60 SP and upgrade to level 2.<br>
Since every skill can be upgraded, it is up to you whether to become an expert in a single skill by concentrating your SP on it, or to become a generalist who learns skills at a lower level.<br>
