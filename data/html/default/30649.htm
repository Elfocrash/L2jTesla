<html><body>Ancestor Martankus:<br>
I am Martankus of the Hestui. Although I've been dead for a thousand years and my body has long turned to ash, my soul remains and watches over my future generations!<br>
This cave is the holy grave of the 7th tribe's heroes and also where young Orcs train their strength! I offer blessings and teachings to great offspring of the flame, but to the filthy invaders if other races, I will show no mercy!<br>
