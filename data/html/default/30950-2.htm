A while back we were visited by investigators from the Ivory Tower. Their scroll of teleport would not function properly here, leading them to surmise that the area around the tower is mysteriously warped. This was likely done by the original designers of the tower in order to prevent invaders from using teleportation to move troops within the tower.<br>
The only teleportation device that works well here is the dimension vortex. We have not determined why it works while other modes of teleportation do not. Dimension stones allow movement between floors. For example, if you want to go to the <font color="LEVEL">10th floor</font>, you need a <font color="LEVEL">Red Dimension Stone</font>. To return to the <font color="LEVEL">first floor</font>, you will need a <font color="LEVEL">Green Dimension Stone</font>.<br>
Unfortunately the demons have discovered the dimension vortex, and are in a frenzy trying to collect all the dimension stones they can find. I suppose they want to control all movement within the tower. If you need a dimension stone, you must take one from a demon. It will not be easy. I wish you luck...! Don't get killed!<br>
