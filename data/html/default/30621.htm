<html><body>Maestro Nikola:<br>
Greetings. Have you come to explore the Cruma Tower? Isn t it gorgeous? Imagine the secrets that are hidden here in this building which was constructed by the mysterious science of the giants of ere. Isn t it interesting?<br>
My name is Maestro Nikola! I was sent by the Black Anvil guild to investigate this tower. Never had I imagined that such terrible creatures would be here! I am a craftsman, a scientist and sometimes a relic explorer, but I don't do monster clean-up! No thanks! Why isn't the greenhorn from the guild here yet?!<br>
