<html><body>Pa'agrio Guardian Vulkus:<br>
It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Pa'agrio Guardian Vulkus in the Temple of Pa'agrio. Orcs once ruled the world and all its races, but now we live on the plateau, because of the power of the Humans.<br>
Yet it is inevitable that the Orcs will rise again, just as it is inevitable that the everlasting flame of Pa'agrio will continue to burn.<br>
