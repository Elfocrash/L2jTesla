<html><body>Summoner Brynthea:<br>
Greetings, traveler, my name is Brynthea. Summoner's magic is a highly organized magic which makes the spirits obedient through sort of a contract. It is a technique created by the Elves but since it works through govern-obedience rules, it applies well to us Dark Elves, and women in particular... Ha!<br>
