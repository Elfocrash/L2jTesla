<html><body>Maestro Reorin:<br>
It was the evil <font color="LEVEL">Death Lord Hallate</font>. He who leads the army of darkness... He who is known as the insolent invader or the archenemy of the angels. He made me an offer that I couldn't refuse. He promised me that he would help me to create a masterpiece that would go down in history. Ignoring the entreaties of my darling wife I went along with it... and fell into the demon's trap...<br>
This led to his taking of my beloved wife Reiria... Hicupp~!<br>
Oh, what's the use?! I can't bear to think of it anymore! Hiccup~!<br>
Please leave me alone!<br>
