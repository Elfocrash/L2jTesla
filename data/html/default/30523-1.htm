Well ... Only the most elite dwarves can make it to the Bronze Key. <font color="LEVEL">Collector Gentaron</font>, founder of our guild, was the most renowned adventurer! He was so brave that he went into a dragon's nest by himself and brought out its scale! We guild members worship his spirit of adventure and courage, so we travel constantly around the wide world. There is not a single thing that my guild can't find! Once you make a request, we can bring you anything in the world! You must be prepared to pay for it, though!<br>
We, the Bronze Key, venture out into the world to collect rare and precious treasures! If you want to be in our guild, you must train and train some more ...!<br>
