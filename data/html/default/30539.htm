<html><body>Priestess of the Earth Chichirin:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Carna Maphr!</font> May the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth be with you.<br>
The venerated <font color="LEVEL">Hero Lucien</font> had enormous strength and willpower when he fought against the wicked <font color="LEVEL">Earth Wyrm Trasken,</font> saving us Dwarves from the evil creature. Lucien once said, "I, Lucien, have always believed that the Goddess of the Earth is forever with me. Today s victory was only possible because of the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth!" What a wise remark!<br>
We can learn a valuable lesson from Lucien, only those who truly believe in the Goddess's bounty will find what they seek!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Carna Maphr,</font> I'm sure that you too will be blessed if you keep true to your faith.<br>
