<font color="LEVEL">A novice character</font> is one who is new to the world of
Lineage II. Certain benefits are available to novice
characters up to level 25.<br>
Taxes and other charges have led to a steep increase in
prices for armor and weaponry. To help offset this
problem,<font color="LEVEL"> novice characters can exchange their used gear
for full credit towards the purchase of new equipment</font> in
any weapon or armor shop.
Also, the threat of monsters may be overwhelming for
novice characters. I help them as much as possible..<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Come and see me for support magic that is appropriate
for your level.</font>
This will help build the confidence you'll need to challenge
the powerful monsters in this world.<br>

Thirdly,<font color="LEVEL"> Soulshots and Spiritshot for Novices will be given
in addition.</font>
A novice character can receive additional Soulshots and
Spiritshot for novices if he completes a particular quest.
The information for this quest will be provided later.<br>
And lastly, occasionally players find that they wish to
change the race or class of their character.<font color="LEVEL"> Novice
character benefits may be passed to a new character up
to level 6.</font> However, once a character reaches level 6,
then only that character receives benefits as a novice.
