<html><body>Monk of Silence Mennon:<br> 
Greetings, my child. I'm a monk. The Monastery of Silence is currently conducting a holy ritual which is only held once a decade. During this ritual, access to the monastery is restricted to the silent monks in order to prevent external forces from affecting the ritual. You must make a detour. Bless you, my child!<br>
