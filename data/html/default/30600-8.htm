<html><body>I am pleased to tell you what I know, but I do not know everything. You should speak to as many of the villagers as you can.<br>
Have you already spoken to<font color="LEVEL"> Abyssal Celebrant Undrias</font> at teh gate of the Temple of Shilen? He may want to ask a favor of you.<br>
Also, seek out<font color="LEVEL"> Sentry Nelsya</font> at the north entrance of the village. 'Tis the season of Shilen's Hunting Ceremony, and they are looking for volunteers.<br>
Let's see... ah, yes! See that you speak to<font color="LEVEL"> Collette</font> and to Trader Payne as well.<br>
