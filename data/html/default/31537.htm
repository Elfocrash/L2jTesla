<html><body>Beast Herder Tunatun:<br>
Welcome to our pastures. My name is Tunatun, manager of this pasture. I came here thinking I could communicate with wild beasts, but it's not as easy as I thought.<br>
There's nothing I can actually do for them! The only thing I can do around here is buy feed or hire an adventurer to maintain the ranch.<br>
