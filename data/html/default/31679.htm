Hey there, traveler! You wouldn't happen to be carrying out any prohibited items now, would you? We're seeing more and more smuggling across the border lately...<br>
Hmm... Nothing out of the ordinary here, I suppose. Alright, you can go. Have a safe passage on your return trip home.<br>
Say, if you meet that rat Van Deik on the other side, tell him that I'll deal with him soon enough. Tell him that his days are numbered! Keuk!<br>
