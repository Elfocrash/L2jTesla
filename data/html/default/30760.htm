<html><body>Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:<br>
How do you do, young one! My name is Gustav Athebaldt. I am a knight of the royal bodyguard. Although I am approaching the age of retirement, given the current state of affairs I fear for the future of this kingdom...<br>
The future of this nation cannot be left to the caprices of kings and lords. Lords only seek to satisfy their own self-interest and the king denies his people's hardships. Should the future of our nation be left to the devices of such men? If you think that it doesn't matter who rules the country, in no time you will find yourself groaning under the harsh tyranny of a despot.<br>
I believe that we must make the hard decision to take the country to war to avoid this.<br>
