<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
The Hall of Flames leads to Valakas, the fire dragon. It's guarded by the minions of Valakas! If you get past them, you can meet Valakas. To prevent people from entering this dangerous place, no one may actually walk the path...<br>
After all this, you still want to enter the Hall of Flames? Bring me a Floating Stone! Remember, it can be used only once.
