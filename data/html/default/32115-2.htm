You must know which action to use when a Tyrannosaurus tries to cancel a capture skill. When the beast <font color="LEVEL">roars, shakes and writhes</font>, the appropriate capture skills to use are <font color="LEVEL">kabokula, tapirawa and shabonoba.</font> Watch each action of the Tyrannosaurus carefully and respond with the correct skill.<br>
Remember that using a capture skill consumes both capture stones and MP. Be sure to prepare enough of them both! May Shilen bless your efforts!
