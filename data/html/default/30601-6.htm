We Dwarves like creating things more than destroying them, so we don't teach active skills about destroying. Study the master's list, and think about what you'll want to learn in the future as well. If you work hard to earn enough SP, you'll pick up a skill around Level 7. The Create Item skill, which lets you... well, it lets you create items, OK? Now that's a good Dwarven skill. Think about getting that one.<br>
