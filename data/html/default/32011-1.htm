Frintezza is protecting the Force Field. Even though you can pass through it, you can't meet Frintezza yet. He's put some tests in place to keep anyone from interrupting his rest.<br>
These obstacles will test all of your skills, and those of your party as well!<br>
If you pass the tests within a certain amount of time, you can meet Frintezza. This should only be attempted by the brave of heart! <br>
(If you pass the tests within 35 minutes, you'll meet Frintezza.)
