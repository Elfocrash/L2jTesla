<html><body>Elder Keef:<br>
May the abundance of Maphr be with you! Young traveler, welcome to the most boring place in the Dwarven town! I am Keef, a member of the <font color="LEVEL">Bronze Key Guild</font>! I was forced to be the chief of the guild by my brothers.<br>
I hate this boring office work. I can't wait to complete my term and start traveling again. But until then, I am spending time doing business.<br>
