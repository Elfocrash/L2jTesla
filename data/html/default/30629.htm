<html><body>Bard Rukal:<br>
Greetings, fellow traveler. I am Bard Rukal. I collect poems and songs from all the villages around the world.<br>
I have discovered in my travels that the arts of music and magic are branches of the same tree. Elemental magic is like a song from heaven. Mages combine the songs of the spirits in their use of elememtal magic..<br>
