<html><body>Vervato:<br>
I am Vervato! It is my sacred task to cheat death and revive fallen comrades whose spirits are ready to depart for the dark nether regions.<br>
My magic is more powerful than even that of the sorcerers of the Elroki tribe; I am the greatest corpse summoner of them all!<br>
But remember that summoning a corpse is only possible if there is a corpse... and, of course, the requisite fee.<br>
