<html><body>Grand Master Roien:<br>
Welcome. I am Grand Master Roien, of Cedric's Training Hall.<br>
This school was established by the renowned Paladin Sir Cedric, loyal subject of King Raoul the Unifier, to train young Fighters. One day, perhaps, in your travels you will be able to meet Sir Cedric, whom I have the honor to call my uncle, in the Kingdom of Aden.<br>
