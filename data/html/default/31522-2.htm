The Dark Arts involve forbidden practices of magic. They allow complete intervention into the matters of life and death! The practitioners of this type of magic usually focus their attention on the moment when life and death co-exist, when a life is created and when a life disappears.<br>
Objects that have experienced both life and death but have not returned to nature yet...such as the bones of the dead... All are indispensable ingredients of the dark arts!<br>
