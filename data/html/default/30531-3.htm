<html><body>First Elder Lockirin:<br>
The top six guilds are: the Golden Wheel, the Silver Scale, the Bronze Key, the Black Anvil, the Gray Column, and the Iron Gate, to which I belong. If you want to know more about other guilds, just ask the Elders here. All of them can easily brag about their guilds for hours, so you are likely to learn more than you wanted.<br>
