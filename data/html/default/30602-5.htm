You can begin to learn skills when you reach level 5. You will recieve instruction in new skills at the Warrior Guild, which is the room on the right when you enter the House of the King, the biggest building in the village, right in the center of town. The prefects there will teach you your skills.<br>
Now, pay attention; you'll need<font color="LEVEL"> SP</font> to gain your skills. SP is short for "skill points", and they're earned along with the experience whenever you defeat a monster. SP are deducted whenever you learn a new skill. You can check your SP by clicking the Character Status button, then on the Status tab in the window. Of course, the number of SP you need will vary, depending on the skill you're after.<br>
If you use your head while hunting, you should have about 60 SP by the time you reach level 5. The prefects can tell you the skills in which you can train.<br>
Skills are divided into active skills and passive skills.<font color="LEVEL"> Active skills</font> require that you intentionally use them, while passive skills increase your basic abilities from the moment you learn them. At level 5, you'll want to learn active offensive skills first. Power Strike is for those who fight with a sword, Iron Fist for hand-to-hand Fighters.<br>
