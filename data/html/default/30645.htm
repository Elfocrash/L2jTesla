<html><body>Martian:<br>
Nice to meet you, young friend! My name is Martian. I am the security manager of the Traders' Guild of Giran.<br>
The traders work hard to accumulate their wealth, but there are always those who lust after the profits of others. It is especially true in places like here, which is the center of the continent's economy. Bugbear pillagers, Orc gangs, ratmen thieves... The troops that I have hired can barely rest, as they must protect the traders' riches from those gangs day and night.<br>
