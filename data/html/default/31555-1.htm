<html><body>Mercenary Supplier Abercrombie:<br>
As usual, the delivery of supplies are very unreliable in this godforsaken swampland! My life is totally miserable! The monsters around here are a real pain! I should've known when they sent me out here to the northernmost corner of nowhere... Dammit! What am I doing here!? They don't pay me enough! I don't know what my bosses are thinking!<br>
When Sighardt led the mercenary army, things like this never happened! Challenges always existed, but at least life was liveable!<br>
Did you want an item? Hold on, give me a moment. I must check the list. By the way, you brought a chit didn't you?<br>
