<html><body>Shilen's Stone Statue:<br>
You know that in the past, Mother Shilen paid a great sacrifice to lock Sailren here.<br>
Afterward, she created a stone likeness of herself and bestowed upon it the power to seal, making it a guardian of this place to ensure that Sailren remained imprisoned.<br>
I am that stone statue of Shilen.<br>
Mother Shilen also entrusted the power to seal to those who wield the sacred axe Gazkh.<br>
I will only open the gate for those who have Gazkh and their friends. When the seal is at its weakest, however, I allow a warrior to enter in order to minimize the sacrifice.<br>
