This place has been the boundary between the two kingdoms for hundreds of years. I trust that you will behave yourself among the foreigners and do nothing to bring discredit, dishonor or even embarrassment upon Aden Kingdom.<br>
Should you meet "Yeus" on the other side, I'd be obliged if you would give him greetings from me. I know that would make him very happy...<br>
