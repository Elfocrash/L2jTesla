I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued by the Priests of Pa'agrio, That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?<br>
Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember to pay attention to what you find while hunting monsters - you can find armour, and sometimes even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you might find<font color="LEVEL"> cloth shoes, apprentice's shoes, or a cloth cap</font>.<br>
You should have been given two weapons, a squire's sword and training gloves. Even a novice like you can tell the difference between a sword and a brawling weapon, I think. The<font color="LEVEL"> training gloves (hand-to-hand weapon)</font> hit twice as often as other weapons, but they're not as powerful. Plus, you need both hands, so forget about a shield. Now the squire's sword (one-handed sword) is much sower than the gloves, but is more accurate and does more damage. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worth weapon - it is up to you to decide which suits you best.<br>
Come back when you reach<font color="LEVEL"> level 6</font> and we'll talk more about weapons.
