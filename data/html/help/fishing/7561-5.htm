<html><body>How to Fish:<br>
As you perfect the fishing techniques taught by the Fishermen's Guild, you must try to catch higher-grade fish. Actually, as your skills increase, you'll no longer be allowed to catch the low-grade fish you once caught. <br>
However, as your skills increase, you must be careful, since you'll no longer catch the fish that bite easily. High-level fish are physically stronger and smarter than low-level fish. <br>
The greater your skills, the more difficult fishing will become. <br>
You must work on your reeling and pumping techniques. <br>
