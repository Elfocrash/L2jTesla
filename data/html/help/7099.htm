<html><body>Khavatari Spirit Spellbook:<br>
You who follow the path of Khavatari, fear Ajirua!<br>
The teachings of Khavatari are purely logical. Wind stokes and douses fire, and delivers it to the surface of the body.<br>
Fire creates tremendous energy in the body, and allows learning of the powerful techniques of Khavatari. But this method uses the power of Ajirua rather than Pa'agrio. Be careful!<br>
