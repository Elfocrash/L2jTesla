Haures: Subordinate of Tanakia, a Fallen Angel. Haures is accompanied by his minions. Legend says that Haures tends to overwork his subordinates, and they're vulnerable to Sleep magic. Also, since he's a devil, he's vulnerable to Sacred Energy magic. If you run into him and are capable of using Holy magic, attack him with it. If you don't have that capability, run away!</body></html>
