<html><body>Possession of a Departed Soul and Its Danger:<br>
This technique involves focusing on a dead soul and receiving it into one's own body. However, this also means that one must give up one's freedom to communicate with the dead and will be bound by that soul which has entered the body.<br>
 No shaman, warcryer or dead soul will exist. It becomes one monstrous being. The six noble Orc tribes are very well aware of this!<br>
However, if some stupid shaman couldn't resist temptation and allowed himself to be possessed, he must be separated from it. The possessed being, that is the shaman, will lose his life and his soul will be eaten by the dead soul. Under the circumstances this is the only solution.<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> First, inflict a strong impact, such as Stun, on the possessed being.</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL"> After that, use the magic to suck all the blood such as Steal Essence from him in order to weaken the possession of the soul as much. </font><br>
Once the possession is lifted and the possessed being dies, the dead soul regains its freedom.</body></html>
