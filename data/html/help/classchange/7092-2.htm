Lillian is Death Lord Hallate's witch. Rumors say... (Omission)... Until now, her whereabouts have been a well-kept secret. Recently she's been seen near here! She must have an agenda. She's famous for dancing the dance of curse. Once she starts, you must do all you can to survive. I've heard that dance of inspiration, dance of fury and dance of vampire are effective against her. Guild members are advised not to approach her.
