<html><body>Form of a Corrupt Knight:<br>
Although Adhil has perfect defensive technique, he isn't invincible. His hot temper will be his downfall! Hate skills are temporarily effective against his defenses.<br>
Don't forget, his nickname on the battlefield is "The Stress Storm". He relies too much on his flawless defense capability when he attacks. You must defend yourself to the utmost of your ability!<br>
Ultimate Defense is often successful against his attack.
