Chimera Golem: Created as a result of research conducted by hermits, the golem escaped the research center. Although a few years have passed, victims attacked by the golem are still being found. This article was written to prepare for an encounter.<br>
(Omission) Unlike other golems, it can run very fast, but only temporarily. It has a sturdy body, but can be easily attacked when worked up due to the hate skill series. It's likely to be reckless when stimulated. It's best to avoid the golem entirely.
