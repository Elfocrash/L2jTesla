<html><body>Critique of Biel's Songs:<br>
Legend says that the songs of Biel contained a magic power that could control an audience. The three types of magic in her songs are: seduction, sweet whispers and temptation.<br>
In her time, she captivated her audience. It's said that Eva grew jealous, and created a flaw in each of her songs.<br>
When a Song of Seduction is sung, the notes enter the listener's body and gradually make it heavier. The cure for this is the Song of Wind.<br>
The Song of Whisper removes the listener's desire to attack. The Antidote for this is the Song of Water.<br>
The Song of Temptation makes listeners defenseless. The Song of Vengeance removes the effect.</body></html>
