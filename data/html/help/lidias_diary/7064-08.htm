The Darkness of Abyss<br><br>
The starlight is reflected in his smile.<br>
He speaks of courage, but I don't know where or even who I am!<br>
Can a crazy person have courage? Who knows?<br>
His laughter rings out, and again the word, courage. There are other words, but they're in an otherworldly language I don't understand.<br>
The Dark Mage with his dark smile speaks softly to me, holding my hand in the dark night.<br>
Courage. Courage. Courage. Nothing else matters.<br>
My ceremony is still going on! What brings you here so late?<br>
