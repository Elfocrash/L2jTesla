[A different handwriting]<br>
I don't understand! Obviously I did it, but without knowing! I look in the mirror and her face looks back at me, but there is no mirror! Only an image. I don't understand any of this! Where are my memories? They seem to be there, but unaccessible! He must have done something to me!<br>
Everything that happens is recorded but forgotten! Both regret and satisfaction are the result. The Moon Face Flower on your hairpin will seal this Contract.<br>
