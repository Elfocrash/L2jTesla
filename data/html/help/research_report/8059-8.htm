The Dwarves are gone at last! The Ultimate Golem is triumphant!<br>
I only wish I could control it! Does it dare defy me, just because I'm not a giant? What nerve! No one treats the great Dr. Chaos like this!<br>
I will tame you, Golem!<br>
But there are more urgent matters...<br>
There was a terrible explosion in the north wing today! I'm afraid it was a power overload. I didn't touch anything.<br>
I must devise a Golem to keep this place under control! I don't have time to deal with Spartacus now... I'll have to start with Wendy...
