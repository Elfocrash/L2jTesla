I've finally gotten it to output some energy, but it just won't work properly.<br>
I theorized that the tower in the middle of the room was some sort of control device. I connected the Golem to the tower and it immediately began to output some strange sort of data. <font color="LEVEL">W.D.L.</font>? Could this be some sort of recognition code?<br>
